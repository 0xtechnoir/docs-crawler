## Arcade Overview ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/arcade/overview

### TL;DR: Arcade is:

* A unified hub for all your favorite onchain games
* A frictionless bridge between developers and players
* A permissionless platform for game registration and publishing
* Designed to enhance discoverability, engagement, and player experience
* Leverage NFTs for ownership and control of your games and editions

## Key Features

### üéÆ Register a Game

Game studios can register a game freely, without needing permission.
When creating a game for the first time, you‚Äôll be asked to provide its metadata and define at least one Game Edition.

When you register a game or an edition, an NFT representing its ownership is minted.
This NFT grants you admin rights over the game or edition.
You can update the metadata of your game or any edition at any time ‚Äî including name, description, icon, image gallery, video, and more.

### üöÄ Publish a Game

Once your game is registered, you can publish it to request a review.
After approval, the game will be whitelisted and made publicly visible to all users on the platform.

### üß© Create and update Game Editions

You can create new editions of your game at any time ‚Äî each edition gets its own ownership NFT.
As the game owner, you control which editions are visible or hidden.
As the edition owner, you can choose to publish or hide your edition from public view.

### üöÄ Publish and whitelist an Edition

As the edition owner you have the ability to publish your edition once created.
Once published, the game owner has the ability to whitelist you Edition to make it public.

## Arcade Setup ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/arcade/setup

## Torii Configuration

To provide a rich user experience in Arcade, we recommend enhancing your Torii configuration to enable live activity feeds, asset indexing, and leaderboards.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Activity Feed

Display live player activity on your Arcade edition page.

```
[indexing]
transactions = true
```

### üíÑ Player Asset Indexing

Index and display custom in-game assets tied to your players.

```
[indexing]
contracts = [
    "ERC20:0x1234...5678",
    "ERC721:0x1234...5678",
]
```

### ‚ú® Leaderboard Integration

Enable live leaderboards based on progression events or achievements (if implemented).

```
[sql]
historical = ["<YOUR-NAMESPACE>-TrophyProgression"]
```

Only add TrophyProgression if your game emits progression events through achievements.

## Achievements ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/achievements

The Cartridge Achievements is a system for games to reward players for completing achievements.

## Key Features

* **Packages**: Games can define achievements thanks to the provided packages.
* **Rewards**: Games can reward players with Cartridge points for completing achievements.
* **Profile**: Players can view their achievements and scores whitout leaving the game.

## Benefits for Game Developers

* **Simplicity**: Easy integration with existing Starknet smart contracts and Dojo.
* **Cost-effectiveness**: Achievements are events based, no additional storage is required.
* **Performance** (coming soon): Plugin attached to Torii to improve the performances of the achievements computation.

## How It Works?

For detailed implementation and usage, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/arcade).

### Creation

The game world describes the achievements and the corresponding tasks to unlock them.
Each achievement is defined by (not exhaustive) a unique `identifier`, a `title`, a `description` and a set of `tasks`.
Each task is defined by an `identifier`, a `total` and a `description`.
The completion of a task is done when enough progression has been made by a player regarding a specific task.
The achievement is completed when all included tasks are completed.

### Progression

The progression of each individual task is done by the game by emitting events associated to a `task` and a `player`.
Each progression provides a `counter` to add to the player progression.
A task completion is the sum of all the progression events emitted for a specific `task` (defined by the `identifier`).

### Integration

The status of the achievement is computed off-chain by the controller, it starts when the controller is initialized on the client.

## Controller Configuration ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/configuration

Controller provides several configuration options related to chains, sessions, and theming.

## ControllerOptions

```
export type Chain = {
  rpcUrl: string;
};
 
export type ControllerOptions = {
    // Chain configuration
    chains?: Chain[];  // Custom RPC endpoints (takes precedence over default chains)
    defaultChainId?: string;  // Default chain to use (hex encoded). If using Starknet React, this gets overridden by the same param in StarknetConfig
    
    // Session options 
    policies?: SessionPolicies;  // Optional: Session policies for pre-approved transactions
    propagateSessionErrors?: boolean;  // Propagate transaction errors back to caller
    
    // Customization options
    preset?: string;  // Preset name for custom themes and verified policies
    slot?: string;  // Slot project name for custom indexing
};
```

## Chain Configuration

Controller provides default Cartridge RPC endpoints for Starknet mainnet and sepolia networks:

* `https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet`
* `https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia`

When you provide custom chains via the `chains` option, they take precedence over the default Cartridge chains if they specify the same network. This allows you to:

* Use custom RPC endpoints for mainnet or sepolia
* Add support for additional networks (like Slot katana instances)
* Override default chain configurations

**Example:**

```
const controller = new Controller({
  chains: [
    { rpcUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/my-game/sepolia" }, // Overrides default sepolia
    { rpcUrl: "http://localhost:5050" }, // Adds local development chain
  ],
  chainId: constants.StarknetChainId.SN_SEPOLIA,
});
```

## Configuration Categories

The configuration options are organized into several categories:

* **Chain Options**: Core network configuration and chain settings
* [**Session Options**](/controller/sessions): Session policies and transaction-related settings
* **Customization Options**: [Presets](/controller/presets) for themes and verified policies, [Slot](/controller/inventory) for custom indexing

## When to Use Policies

**Policies are optional** in Cartridge Controller. Choose based on your application's needs:

### Use Policies When:

* Building games that need frequent, seamless transactions
* You want gasless transactions via Cartridge Paymaster
* Users should not be interrupted with approval prompts during gameplay
* You need session-based authorization for better UX

### Skip Policies When:

* Building simple applications with occasional transactions
* Manual approval for each transaction is acceptable
* You don't need gasless transaction capabilities
* You want minimal setup complexity

```
// Without policies - simple setup, manual approvals
const simpleController = new Controller();
 
// With policies - session-based, gasless transactions
const sessionController = new Controller({
  policies: {
    // ... policy definitions
  }
});
```

## Controller Getting Started ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/getting-started

Controller implements a standard StarkNet account interface and can be
seamlessly integrated into your application like any other wallet.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to install the controller package and connect to Cartridge:

```
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";
 
const controller = new Controller({});
const account = await controller.connect();
 
// You're ready to execute transactions!
```

## Installation

npmpnpmyarnbun

npm

```
npm install @cartridge/controller starknet
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to initialize and use the controller:

```
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";
 
// Initialize the controller without policies
// This requires manual approval for each transaction
const controller = new Controller();
 
// Connect to get an account instance
const account = await controller.connect();
 
// Execute transactions - user will see approval dialog
const tx = await account.execute([
  {
    contractAddress: "0x...",
    entrypoint: "my_function",
    calldata: ["0x1", "0x2"],
  }
]);
```

> **Note:** When no policies are provided, each transaction requires manual user approval through the Cartridge interface. This is suitable for simple applications or testing, but games typically benefit from using [session policies](/controller/getting-started#configuration-with-session-policies) for a smoother experience.

## Configuration with Session Policies

For games that need gasless transactions and session management:

```
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";
 
const controller = new Controller({
  policies: {
    contracts: {
      // Your game contract
      "0x1234...": {
        name: "My Game Contract",
        methods: [
          {
            name: "move_player",
            entrypoint: "move_player",
            description: "Move player character",
          },
          {
            name: "attack",
            entrypoint: "attack", 
            description: "Attack enemy",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Usage with Starknet React

```
import React from "react";
import { sepolia, mainnet } from "@starknet-react/chains";
import {
  StarknetConfig,
  jsonRpcProvider,
  starkscan,
} from "@starknet-react/core";
import ControllerConnector from "@cartridge/connector/controller";
 
// Create the connector outside the component to avoid recreation on renders
const connector = new ControllerConnector();
 
// Configure the JSON RPC provider
const provider = jsonRpcProvider({
  rpc: (chain) => {
    switch (chain) {
      case mainnet:
        return { nodeUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet" };
      case sepolia:
      default:
        return { nodeUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia" };
    }
  },
});
 
export function StarknetProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <StarknetConfig
      defaultChainId={sepolia.id}
      chains={[mainnet, sepolia]}
      provider={provider}
      connectors={[connector]}
      explorer={starkscan}
    >
      {children}
    </StarknetConfig>
  );
}
```

* Platform authenticators (Face ID, Touch ID)
* Password managers (Bitwarden, 1Password)

## Platform Support

Passkeys are [generally well supported](https://www.passkeys.io/compatible-devices) across modern platforms. You can use them with:

* Device authenticators directly
* Mobile device pairing via QR code flow

If you device does not natively support them, there are several password managers that support Passkey creation and management:

* [Bitwarden (free)](https://bitwarden.com/help/storing-passkeys/)
* [1Password](https://1password.com/)
* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)

When using a password manager, be sure to install the browser extension as well.

## Backup Solutions

Passkey backup is handled differently depending on your platform or password manager:

#### Apple Devices

Passkeys are backed up with your keychain in iCloud. [Learn more](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)

#### Android Devices

Passkeys are backed up with your Google account. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13168025)

#### Windows Devices

Passkeys can be created and managed as part of your Windows account. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys)

## Multi-Signer Support

Passkeys can be used as part of Controller's multi-signer functionality, allowing you to add multiple authentication methods to your account. This provides backup access and additional security options.

Learn more about adding and managing multiple signers in the [Signer Management](/controller/signer-management) guide.

  }
}
```

See an example pull request [`here`](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/presets/pull/8/files)

## Verified Sessions

Session Policies can be provided in the preset configuration, providing a smoother experience for your users. In order to submit verified policies, create a commit with them to your applications `config.json` in [`@cartridge/presets`](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/presets/tree/main/configs).

For an example, see [dope-wars](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/presets/blob/main/configs/dope-wars/config.json):

```
{
  "origin": "dopewars.game",
  "chains": {
    "SN_MAIN": {
      "policies": {
        "contracts": {
          "0x051Fea4450Da9D6aeE758BDEbA88B2f665bCbf549D2C61421AA724E9AC0Ced8F": {
            "name": "VRF Provider",
            "description": "Provides verifiable random functions",
            "methods": [
              {
                "name": "Request Random",
                "description": "Request a random number",
                "entrypoint": "request_random"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
}
```

## Apple App Site Association

The [Apple App Site Association (AASA)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains) configuration enables iOS app integration with Cartridge Controller, allowing for usage of Web Credentials (Passkeys) in native applications.

### Configuration

To add your iOS app to the AASA file, include the `apple-app-site-association` section in your game's `config.json`:

#### JSON Configuration

```
{
  "apple-app-site-association": {
    "webcredentials": {
      "apps": ["ABCDE12345.com.example.yourgame"]
    }
  },
}
```

## Sessions and Policies ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/sessions

Cartridge Controller supports session-based authorization and policy-based transaction approvals. When policies are pre-approved by the user, games can execute transactions seamlessly without requesting approval for each interaction, creating a smooth gaming experience.

## How Sessions Work

1. **Policy Definition**: Games define which contract methods they need to call
2. **User Approval**: Users approve these policies once during initial connection
3. **Session Creation**: Controller creates a session with approved transaction permissions
4. **Gasless Execution**: Games can execute approved transactions without user prompts
5. **Paymaster Integration**: Transactions can be sponsored through Cartridge Paymaster

## Transactions Without Policies

Cartridge Controller can execute transactions **without** defining policies. When no policies are provided:

* Each transaction requires manual user approval via the Cartridge interface
* Users will see a confirmation screen for every transaction
* No gasless transactions or paymaster integration
* Suitable for simple applications that don't need session-based authorization

```
// Controller without policies - requires manual approval for each transaction
const controller = new Controller();
const account = await controller.connect();
 
// This will prompt the user for approval
const tx = await account.execute([
  {
    contractAddress: "0x123...",
    entrypoint: "transfer",
    calldata: ["0x456...", "100"],
  }
]);
```

## Sessions vs. Manual Approval

| Feature | With Policies (Sessions) | Without Policies (Manual) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transaction Approval | Pre-approved via policies | Manual approval each time |
| User Experience | Seamless gameplay | Confirmation prompts |
| Gasless Transactions | Yes (via Paymaster) | No |
| Setup Complexity | Higher (policy definition) | Lower (basic setup) |
| Best For | Games, frequent transactions | Simple apps, occasional transactions |

## Session Options

```
export type SessionOptions = {
  rpc: string;                // RPC endpoint URL
  chainId: string;            // Chain ID for the session
  policies: SessionPolicies;  // Approved transaction policies
  redirectUrl: string;        // URL to redirect after registration
};
```

## Defining Policies

Policies allow your application to define permissions that can be pre-approved by the user:

```
type SessionPolicies = {
  contracts: {
    [address: string]: ContractPolicy;  // Contract interaction policies
  };
  messages?: TypedDataMessage[];        // Optional signed message policies
};
 
type ContractPolicy = {
  name?: string;                        // Human-readable name of the contract
  description?: string;                 // Description of the contract
  methods: Method[];                    // Allowed contract methods
};
 
type ContractMethod = {
  name: string;                         // Method name
  entrypoint: string;                   // Contract method entrypoint
  description?: string;                 // Optional method description
};
 
type SignMessagePolicy = TypedDataPolicy & {
  name?: string;                        // Human-readable name of the policy
  description?: string;                 // Description of the policy
};
 
type TypedDataPolicy = {
  types: Record<string, StarknetType[]>;
  primaryType: string;
  domain: StarknetDomain;
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Contract Interaction Policies Example

```
const policies: SessionPolicies = {
  contracts: {
    "0x4ed3a7c5f53c6e96186eaf1b670bd2e2a3699c08e070aedf4e5fc6ac246ddc1": {
      name: "Pillage",
      description: "Allows you to raid a structure and pillage resources",
      methods: [
        {
          name: "Battle Pillage",
          description: "Pillage a structure",
          entrypoint: "battle_pillage"
        }
      ]
    },
    "0x2620f65aa2fd72d705306ada1ee7410023a3df03da9291f1ccb744fabfebc0": {
      name: "Battle contract",
      description: "Required to engage in battles",
      methods: [
        {
          name: "Battle Start",
          description: "Start a battle",
          entrypoint: "battle_start"
        },
        {
          name: "Battle Join",
          description: "Join a battle",
          entrypoint: "battle_join"
        },
        {
          name: "Battle Leave",
          description: "Leave a battle",
          entrypoint: "battle_leave"
        },
      ]
    },
    // Include other contracts as needed
  }
};
 
// Using the controller directly
const controller = new Controller({
  policies,
  // other options
});
 
// Using starknet-react connector
const connector = new CartridgeConnector({
  policies,
  // other options
});
```

### Signed Message Policy Example

Signed Message policies allow the application to sign a typed message without manual approval from the user.

```
const policies: SessionPolicies = {
  messages: [
    {
      name: "Eternum Message Signing",
      description: "Allows signing messages for Eternum",
      types: {
        StarknetDomain: [
          { name: "name", type: "shortstring" },
          { name: "version", type: "shortstring" },
          { name: "chainId", type: "shortstring" },
          { name: "revision", type: "shortstring" }
        ],
        "s0_eternum-Message": [
          { name: "identity", type: "ContractAddress" },
          { name: "channel", type: "shortstring" },
          { name: "content", type: "string" },
          { name: "timestamp", type: "felt" },
          { name: "salt", type: "felt" }
        ]
      },
      primaryType: "s0_eternum-Message",
      domain: {
        name: "Eternum",
        version: "1",
        chainId: "SN_MAIN",
        revision: "1"
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

### Verified Sessions

Verified session policies provide a better user experience by attesting to the validity of a games session policy configuration, providing confidence to it's players.

Verified configs can be committed to the `configs` folder in [`@cartridge/presets`](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/presets/tree/main/configs).

Before they are merged, the team will need to collaborate with Cartridge to verify the policies.

## Adding Signers

### Accessing Signer Management

> **Important**: The "Add Signer" functionality is currently disabled while under development. This feature will be re-enabled in a future update.

1. Connect to your Controller account using any existing authentication method
2. Open the **Settings** panel within the Controller interface
3. Navigate to the **Signer(s)** section
4. ~~Click **Add Signer** to begin adding a new authentication method~~ (Currently disabled)

> **Note**: When re-enabled, signer management will be available on **Mainnet only**. The "Add Signer" button will be disabled on testnet environments.

### Adding a Passkey

> **Currently Disabled**: This functionality is temporarily unavailable while under development.

~~1. In the Add Signer interface, select **Passkey**~~
~~2. Your browser will prompt you to create a new Passkey using:~~
~~- Device biometrics (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello)~~
~~- Hardware security key (USB, NFC, or Bluetooth)~~
~~- Password manager (if configured for Passkey storage)~~
~~3. Follow your device's authentication flow~~
~~4. Once created, the Passkey will be added to your account~~

### Adding Social Login

#### Adding Google Login

1. Select **Google** from the signer options
2. You'll be redirected to Google's OAuth authorization page
3. Sign in to your Google account if not already logged in
4. Authorize Cartridge Controller to access your Google identity
5. The Google login will be linked to your Controller account

#### Adding Discord Login

> **Currently Disabled**: This functionality is temporarily unavailable while under development.

~~1. Select **Discord** from the signer options~~
~~2. You'll be redirected to Discord's OAuth authorization page~~
~~3. Sign in to your Discord account if not already logged in~~
~~4. Authorize Cartridge Controller to access your Discord identity~~
~~5. The Discord login will be linked to your Controller account~~

### Adding External Wallets

> **Currently Disabled**: This functionality is temporarily unavailable while under development.

~~1. Select **Wallet** to see external wallet options~~
~~2. Choose from the supported wallet types:~~
~~- **MetaMask**: Ensure MetaMask extension is installed and unlocked~~
~~- **Rabby**: Ensure Rabby extension is installed and unlocked~~  
~~- **WalletConnect**: Use QR code or deep link to connect mobile/desktop wallets~~
~~3. Follow the wallet-specific connection flow~~
~~4. Sign the verification message to link the wallet to your account~~

## Managing Existing Signers

### Viewing Your Signers

The Signer(s) section displays all authentication methods associated with your account:

* **Signer type** with recognizable icons (fingerprint for Passkey, Discord logo, wallet icons)
* **Current status** indicating which signer you're currently using
* **Identifying information** such as wallet addresses (partially masked for privacy)

### Signer Information Display

Each signer card shows:

* **Type**: Passkey, Google, Discord, MetaMask, Rabby, or WalletConnect
* **Status**: "(current)" label for the active authentication method
* **Identifier**: Shortened wallet address for external wallets, or authentication type for others

### Switching Between Signers

When connecting to your Controller:

* The connection interface will show all available authentication methods
* Select any of your registered signers to authenticate
* Your account and assets remain the same regardless of which signer you use

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices

* **Multiple Backups**: Add at least 2-3 different signer types to ensure account recovery
* **Secure Storage**: For Passkeys, ensure your device backup (iCloud, Google) is secure
* **External Wallet Security**: Keep your wallet seed phrases secure and never share them
* **Regular Access**: Periodically test each authentication method to ensure they work

### Account Recovery

If you lose access to your primary authentication method:

1. Use any other registered signer to access your account
2. Consider adding additional backup authentication methods
3. Remove compromised signers if necessary (feature coming soon)

### Current Limitations

* **Deletion**: Signer removal functionality is planned but not yet available
* **Mainnet Only**: Signer management is currently restricted to Mainnet
* **No Hierarchy**: All signers have equal access; there's no primary/secondary distinction

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Must be on Mainnet" message**

* Signer management is only available on Mainnet
* Switch to Mainnet network to add or manage signers

**Passkey creation fails**

* Ensure your device supports WebAuthn/FIDO2
* Try using a password manager with Passkey support
* Check that your browser is up to date

**External wallet connection fails**

* Verify the wallet extension is installed and unlocked
* Ensure you're on a supported network
* Check that the wallet isn't connected to another dApp

**Google login issues**

* Verify you're logged into Google in the same browser
* Check that third-party cookies are enabled
* Try clearing browser cache and cookies

**Discord login issues**

* Verify you're logged into Discord in the same browser
* Check that third-party cookies are enabled
* Try clearing browser cache and cookies

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with signer management:

* Check the [Passkey Support](/controller/passkey-support) guide for WebAuthn-specific help
* Verify your wallet setup in the respective wallet's documentation
* Ensure you're using a supported browser and have the latest wallet extensions installed

## Next Steps

* Learn about [Session Keys](/controller/sessions) for gasless gaming transactions
* Explore [Controller Configuration](/controller/configuration) options
* Set up [Usernames](/controller/usernames) for your account

## Username Lookup ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/usernames

A service for looking up usernames and addresses in the Cartridge ecosystem. You can use either the helper methods from the SDK or query the endpoint directly.

## Direct API Access

The lookup endpoint can be accessed directly via HTTP POST:

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"usernames": ["shinobi","sensei"]}' \
  https://api.cartridge.gg/accounts/lookup
```

Request Format

```
{
  usernames?: string[];  // Look up addresses for usernames
  addresses?: string[];  // Look up usernames for addresses
}
```

Response Format

```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "username": "shinobi",
      "addresses": ["0x123..."]  // Array of addresses - future support for multiple controllers/signers
    },
    {
      "username": "sensei",
      "addresses": ["0x456..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note**: The API response includes an array of addresses per username to support multiple controllers/signers in the future. Currently, the helper methods assume a 1:1 relationship and use only the first address.

## Helper Methods

For convenience, you can also use the helper methods which include caching:

```
npm install @cartridge/controller
```

```
import { lookupUsernames, lookupAddresses } from '@cartridge/controller';
 
// Look up addresses for usernames
const userMap = await lookupUsernames(['shinobi']);
console.log(userMap.get('shinobi')); // Returns address: '0x123...'
 
// Look up usernames for addresses
const addressMap = await lookupAddresses(['0x123...']);
console.log(addressMap.get('0x123...')); // Returns username: 'shinobi'
```

### `lookupUsernames(usernames: string[]): Promise<Map<string, string>>`

* Fetches addresses for given usernames.
* Input: Array of usernames
* Returns: Map of username to address
* Caching: Results are automatically cached

### `lookupAddresses(addresses: string[]): Promise<Map<string, string>>`

* Fetches usernames for given addresses.
* Input: Array of addresses
* Returns: Map of address to username
* Caching: Results are automatically cached

## Limitations and Rate Limiting

When using the lookup methods or directly via the API, be aware of the following limitations and rate limiting measures:

1. **Maximum Items**: You can fetch up to 1000 items total in a single call, combining both addresses and usernames. For example:

   * 1000 addresses OR
   * 1000 usernames OR
   * Any combination (e.g., 400 addresses + 600 usernames)
2. **Rate Limiting**: The API is rate-limited to 10 requests per second to prevent overloading the server.
3. **Address Format Requirements**:

   * Addresses must be lowercase non-zero-padded hex
   * The helper methods handle address formatting automatically

## Error Handling

The lookup methods may throw errors in the following cases:

* If you provide more than 1000 addresses in a single call.
* If you exceed the rate limit of 10 requests per second.
* If there are network issues or the API is unavailable.

Always wrap your calls to lookup methods in a try-catch block to handle potential errors gracefully.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when fetching usernames:

1. Batch your requests: Instead of making multiple calls for individual addresses, group them into a single call (up to 1000 addresses).
2. Utilize the built-in caching of the helper methods: Previously fetched usernames are cached, so subsequent requests for the same addresses will be faster.
3. Be mindful of the rate limit: If you need to fetch usernames for more than 1000 addresses, implement your own throttling mechanism to avoid hitting the rate limit.

By following these guidelines, you can efficiently fetch and display usernames for controller addresses in your Cartridge-powered application.

## Controller Node.js Integration ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/examples/node

This guide demonstrates how to integrate the Cartridge Controller with a Node.js application.

## Installation

npmpnpmyarnbun

npm

```
npm install @cartridge/controller starknet
```

## Basic Setup

```
import SessionProvider, {
  ControllerError,
} from "@cartridge/controller/session/node";
import { constants } from "starknet";
import path from "path";
 
export const STRK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7";
 
async function main() {
  // Path to store session
  const storagePath =
    process.env.CARTRIDGE_STORAGE_PATH ||
    path.join(process.cwd(), ".cartridge");
 
  // Create a session provider
  const provider = new SessionProvider({
    rpc: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia",
    chainId: constants.StarknetChainId.SN_SEPOLIA,
    policies: {
      contracts: {
        [STRK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS]: {
          methods: [
            {
              name: "approve",
              entrypoint: "approve",
              description: "Approve spending of tokens",
            },
            { name: "transfer", entrypoint: "transfer" },
          ],
        },
      },
    },
    basePath: storagePath,
  });
 
  try {
    // Connect and create session
    const account = await provider.connect();
    console.log("Session initialized!");
 
    if (account) {
      console.log("Account address:", account.address);
 
      // Example: Transfer STRK
      const amount = "0x0";
      const recipient = account.address; // Replace with actual recipient address
 
      const result = await account.execute([
        {
          contractAddress: STRK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
          entrypoint: "transfer",
          calldata: [recipient, amount, "0x0"],
        },
      ]);
 
      console.log("Transaction hash:", result.transaction_hash);
    } else {
      console.log("Please complete the session creation in your browser");
    }
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    const controllerError = error as ControllerError;
    if (controllerError.code) {
      console.error("Session error:", {
        code: controllerError.code,
        message: controllerError.message,
        data: controllerError.data,
      });
    } else {
      console.error("Session error:", error);
    }
  }
}
 
main().catch(console.error);
```

## Important Notes

1. The `basePath` parameter specifies where session data will be stored. Make sure the directory is writable.
2. When running the application for the first time, you'll need to complete the session creation in your browser. The application will provide instructions.
3. Session data is persisted between runs, so you don't need to create a new session each time.
4. The example includes proper error handling for Controller-specific errors, which include additional context through the `code` and `data` fields.
5. Keep your RPC endpoints and contract addresses secure, preferably in environment variables.

## Controller React Integration ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/examples/react

This guide demonstrates how to integrate the Cartridge Controller with a React application.

## Installation

npmpnpmyarnbun

npm

```
npm install @cartridge/connector @cartridge/controller @starknet-react/core @starknet-react/chains starknet
npm install -D tailwindcss vite-plugin-mkcert
```

## Basic Setup

### 1. Configure the Starknet Provider

First, set up the Starknet provider with the Cartridge Controller connector:

You can customize the `ControllerConnector` by providing configuration options
during instantiation. The `ControllerConnector` accepts an options object that
allows you to configure various settings such as policies, RPC URLs, theme, and
more.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `ControllerConnector` instance must be created outside of any React components. Creating it inside a component will cause the connector to be recreated on every render, which can lead to connection issues.

```
import { sepolia, mainnet } from "@starknet-react/chains";
import {
  StarknetConfig,
  jsonRpcProvider,
  starkscan,
} from "@starknet-react/core";
import ControllerConnector from "@cartridge/connector/controller";
import { SessionPolicies } from "@cartridge/controller";
 
// Define your contract addresses
const ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS =
  '0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7'
 
// Define session policies
const policies: SessionPolicies = {
  contracts: {
    [ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS]: {
      methods: [
        {
          name: "approve",
          entrypoint: "approve",
          description: "Approve spending of tokens",
        },
        { name: "transfer", entrypoint: "transfer" },
      ],
    },
  },
}
 
// Initialize the connector
const connector = new ControllerConnector({
  policies,
  // With the defaults, you can omit chains if you want to use:
  // - chains: [
  //     { rpcUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia" },
  //     { rpcUrl: "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet" },
  //   ]
})
 
// Configure RPC provider
const provider = jsonRpcProvider({
  rpc: (chain: Chain) => {
    switch (chain) {
      case mainnet:
        return { nodeUrl: 'https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet' }
      case sepolia:
      default:
        return { nodeUrl: 'https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia' }
    }
  },
})
 
export function StarknetProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <StarknetConfig
      autoConnect
      defaultChainId={mainnet.id}
      chains={[mainnet, sepolia]}
      provider={provider}
      connectors={[connector]}
      explorer={starkscan}
    >
      {children}
    </StarknetConfig>
  )
}
```

### 2. Create a Wallet Connection Component

Use the `useConnect`, `useDisconnect`, and `useAccount` hooks to manage wallet
connections:

```
import { useAccount, useConnect, useDisconnect } from '@starknet-react/core'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import ControllerConnector from '@cartridge/connector/controller'
import { Button } from '@cartridge/ui'
 
export function ConnectWallet() {
  const { connect, connectors } = useConnect()
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect()
  const { address } = useAccount()
  const controller = connectors[0] as ControllerConnector
  const [username, setUsername] = useState<string>()
 
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!address) return
    controller.username()?.then((n) => setUsername(n))
  }, [address, controller])
 
  return (
    <div>
      {address && (
        <>
          <p>Account: {address}</p>
          {username && <p>Username: {username}</p>}
        </>
      )}
      {address ? (
        <Button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</Button>
      ) : (
        <Button onClick={() => connect({ connector: controller })}>
          Connect
        </Button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 3. Performing Transactions

Execute transactions using the `account` object from `useAccount` hook:

```
import { useAccount, useExplorer } from '@starknet-react/core'

        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 4. Add Components to Your App

```
import { StarknetProvider } from './context/StarknetProvider'
import { ConnectWallet } from './components/ConnectWallet'
import { TransferEth } from './components/TransferEth'
 
function App() {
  return (
    <StarknetProvider>
      <ConnectWallet />
      <TransferEth />
    </StarknetProvider>
  )
}
export default App
```

## Important Notes

Make sure to use HTTPS in development by configuring Vite:

```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import mkcert from 'vite-plugin-mkcert'
 
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), mkcert()],
})
```

## Controller Rust Integration ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/examples/rust

## Installation

Add the `account_sdk` crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
account_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/cartridge-gg/controller-rs.git", package = "account_sdk" }
starknet = "0.10" # Make sure to use a compatible version
```

### Importing Necessary Modules

```
use account_sdk::{
    controller::Controller,
    signers::Signer,
};
use starknet::{
    accounts::Account,
    providers::Provider,
    signers::SigningKey,
    core::types::FieldElement,
};
```

### Setting Up the Controller

Initialize the controller with necessary parameters:

```
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create a signer (replace with your own private key)
    let owner = Signer::Starknet(SigningKey::from_secret_scalar(FieldElement::from_hex_be("0xYourPrivateKey").unwrap()));
 
    // Initialize the provider (replace with your RPC URL)
    let provider = Provider::try_from("http://localhost:5050").unwrap();
    let chain_id = provider.chain_id().await.unwrap();
 
    // Create a new Controller instance
    let username = "testuser".to_string();
    let controller = Controller::new(
        "your_app_id".to_string(),
        username.clone(),
        FieldElement::from_hex_be("0xYourClassHash").unwrap(), // Class hash
        "http://localhost:5050".parse().unwrap(), // RPC URL
        owner.clone(),
        FieldElement::from_hex_be("0xYourControllerAddress").unwrap(), // Controller address
        chain_id,
    );
 
    // Deploy the controller
    controller.deploy().await.unwrap();
 
    // Interact with the controller
    // For example, execute a transaction
    let call = your_function_call(); // Define your function call
    controller.execute(vec![call], None).await.unwrap();
}
```

### Performing Transactions

Define function calls and execute them:

```
fn your_function_call() -> starknet::core::types::FunctionCall {
    starknet::core::types::FunctionCall {
        contract_address: FieldElement::from_hex_be("0xYourContractAddress").unwrap(),
        entry_point_selector: starknet::core::utils::get_selector_from_name("yourEntryPoint").unwrap(),
        calldata: vec![FieldElement::from(123)], // Replace with your calldata
    }
}
```

Execute the function call using the controller:

```
controller.execute(vec![your_function_call()], None).await.unwrap();
```

## Controller Svelte Integration ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/examples/svelte

## Installation

npmpnpmyarnbun

npm

```
npm install @cartridge/controller starknet
```

## Setting Up the Controller

Import the `Controller` and create an instance:

```
// src/routes/+page.svelte
import { onMount } from "svelte";
import Controller from "@cartridge/controller";
import { account, username } from "../stores/account";
import { ETH_CONTRACT } from "../constants";
 
let controller = new Controller({
    policies: {
        contracts: {
            [ETH_CONTRACT]: {
                methods: [
                    {
                        name: "approve",
                        entrypoint: "approve",
                        description: "Approve spending of tokens",
                    },
                    {
                        name: "transfer", 
                        entrypoint: "transfer",
                        description: "Transfer tokens",
                    },
                ],
            },
        },
    },
});
```

### Connecting a Wallet

Use the `connect` method to establish a connection:

```
<script lang="ts">
    async function connect() {
        try {
            const res = await controller.connect();
            if (res) {
                account.set(controller);
                username.set(await controller.username());
            }
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
        }
    }
 
    onMount(async () => {
        if (await controller.probe()) {
            // auto connect
            await connect();
        }
        loading = false;
    });
</script>
 
<button on:click={connect}>Connect</button>
```

### Disconnecting a Wallet

Implement a disconnect function:

```
<script lang="ts">
    function disconnect() {
        controller.disconnect();
        account.set(undefined);
        username.set(undefined);
    }
</script>
 
<button on:click={disconnect}>Disconnect</button>
```

### Displaying User Information

Create a `UserInfo` component to show account details:

```
<!-- src/components/UserInfo.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
    export let accountAddress: string | undefined;
    export let username: string | undefined;
</script>
 
<h2>User Information</h2>
<div>
    {#if accountAddress}
        <p>Account Address: {accountAddress}</p>
    {:else}
        <p>No account connected</p>
    {/if}
 
    {#if username}
        <p>Username: {username}</p>
    {/if}
</div>
```

### Performing Transactions

Create a `TransferEth` component for executing transactions:

```
<!-- src/components/TransferEth.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
    import { AccountInterface } from 'starknet';
    import { ETH_CONTRACT } from '../constants';
    export let account: AccountInterface | undefined;
 
    async function execute(amount: string, manual: boolean) {
        if (!account) return;
 
        try {
            const result = await account.execute([
                {
                    contractAddress: ETH_CONTRACT,
                    entrypoint: manual ? 'increaseAllowance' : 'approve',
                    calldata: [account.address, amount, '0x0']
                },
                {
                    contractAddress: ETH_CONTRACT,
                    entrypoint: 'transfer',
                    calldata: [account.address, amount, '0x0']
                }
            ]);
            console.log('Transaction hash:', result.transaction_hash);
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e);
        }
    }
</script>
 
<h2>Transfer Eth</h2>
<button on:click={() => execute('0x0', false)}>Transfer 0 ETH to self</button>
<button on:click={() => execute('0x1C6BF52634000', false)}>Transfer 0.005 ETH to self</button>
<button on:click={() => execute('0x0', true)}>Manual: Transfer 0 ETH to self</button>
```

### Full Example

Here's how your main `+page.svelte` might look:

```
<script lang="ts">
    import { onMount } from 'svelte';
    import Controller from '@cartridge/controller';
    import { account, username } from '../stores/account';
    import UserInfo from '../components/UserInfo.svelte';
    import TransferEth from '../components/TransferEth.svelte';
    import { ETH_CONTRACT } from '../constants';
 
    let controller = new Controller({
        policies: [
            // ... your policies here
        ]
    });
 
    let loading: boolean = true;
 
    async function connect() {
        // ... connection logic
    }
 
    function disconnect() {
        // ... disconnection logic
    }
 
    onMount(async () => {
        // ... auto-connect logic
    });
</script>
 
<h1>SvelteKit + Controller Example</h1>
 
<div>
    {#if loading}
        <p>Loading</p>
    {:else if $account}
        <button on:click={disconnect}>Disconnect</button>
    {:else}
        <button on:click={connect}>Connect</button>
    {/if}
</div>
 
{#if $account && !loading}
    <UserInfo accountAddress={$account?.address} username={$username} />
    <TransferEth account={$account} />
{/if}
```

This example demonstrates how to set up the Controller, connect/disconnect a wallet, display user information, and perform transactions in a Svelte application using the Cartridge Controller.

## Controller Telegram Integration ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/controller/examples/telegram

## Controller Integration Flow

1. Generate local Stark key pair and store private key in Telegram cloud storage
2. Open session controller page with user's public key
3. Controller registers session public key and returns account info
4. Create controller session account on client
5. Store account info in Telegram cloud storage

---

## Setting up the Session Provider

### 1. Define your configuration:

```
// config.ts
export const RPC_URL = "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/mainnet";
 
// Define your session policies
export const SESSION_POLICIES = {
  contracts: {
    "0x70fc96f845e393c732a468b6b6b54d876bd1a29e41a026e8b13579bf98eec8f": {
      name: "Beast Game Contract",
      description: "Contract for beast game interactions",
      methods: [
        {
          name: "attack",
          entrypoint: "attack",
          description: "Attack the beast",
        },
        {
          name: "claim",
          entrypoint: "claim",
          description: "Claim your tokens",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
 
export const REDIRECT_URI = "https://t.me/hitthingbot/hitthing";
```

### 2. Create the SessionProvider:

```
import { PropsWithChildren, createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { constants } from "starknet";
import SessionConnector from "@cartridge/connector/session";
import { StarknetConfig, jsonRpcProvider } from "@starknet-react/core";
import { useLaunchParams, cloudStorage } from "@telegram-apps/sdk-react";
import { RPC_URL, SESSION_POLICIES, REDIRECT_URI } from "./config";
 
const connector = new SessionConnector({
  policies: SESSION_POLICIES,
  rpc: RPC_URL,
  chainId: constants.StarknetChainId.SN_MAINNET,
  redirectUrl: REDIRECT_URI,
});
 
const provider = jsonRpcProvider({
  rpc: () => ({ nodeUrl: RPC_URL }),
});
 
export function SessionProvider({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <StarknetConfig
      autoConnect
      connectors={[connector]}
      provider={provider}
    >
      {children}
    </StarknetConfig>
  );
}
```

### 3. Use the SessionProvider in your app:

```
// App.tsx
import { SessionProvider } from "./SessionProvider";
 
function App() {
  return (
    <SessionProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}
```

### 4. Use the session in your components:

```
function GameComponent() {
  const { isConnected, connect, disconnect } = useSession();
 
  const handleConnect = async () => {
    try {
      await connect();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to connect:", error);
    }
  };
 
  return (
    <div>
      {!isConnected ? (
        <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect Wallet</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={disconnect}>Disconnect</button>
      )}
      
      {isConnected && (
        <div>
          {/* Your game content */}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Error Handling

```
function GameComponent() {
  const { connect } = useSession();
  const [error, setError] = useState<string>();
 
  const handleConnect = async () => {
    try {
      await connect();
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Failed to connect");
    }
  };
 
  return (
    <div>
      {error && <div className="error">{error}</div>}
      <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

See the full example [here](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/beast-slayers).

## Next.js Configuration for WebAssembly

If you're using Next.js, you'll need to configure it to properly handle WebAssembly modules used by the SessionController and SessionConnector. Create or update your `next.config.js`:

```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  webpack: (config, { isServer, dev }) => {
    // Enable WebAssembly
    config.experiments = {
      asyncWebAssembly: true,
      topLevelAwait: true,
    };
 
    // Fix for WebAssembly in production builds
    if (!dev && isServer) {
      config.output.webassemblyModuleFilename = "chunks/[id].wasm";
      config.plugins.push(new WasmChunksFixPlugin());
    }
 
    return config;
  },
};
 
// Plugin to fix WASM chunk loading in production
class WasmChunksFixPlugin {
  apply(compiler) {
    compiler.hooks.thisCompilation.tap("WasmChunksFixPlugin", (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tap(
        { name: "WasmChunksFixPlugin" },
        (assets) =>
          Object.entries(assets).forEach(([pathname, source]) => {
            if (!pathname.match(/\.wasm$/)) return;
            compilation.deleteAsset(pathname);
 
            const name = pathname.split("/")[1];
            const info = compilation.assetsInfo.get(pathname);
            compilation.emitAsset(name, source, info);
          }),
      );
    });
  }
}
 
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## Slot Getting Started ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/slot/getting-started

Slot is the execution layer of Dojo, supporting rapid provisioning of low latency, dedicated, provable execution contexts, bringing horizontal scalability to the blockchain. It manages the sequencing, proving, and efficient settlement of its execution.

## Installation

Install slotup to manage slot installations and follow the outputted directions.

```
curl -L https://slot.cartridge.sh | bash
```

## Usage

Authenticate with Cartridge

```
slot auth login
```

## Programmatic usage

First, authenticate as mentioned above. Then, run:

```
slot auth token
```

Follow instructions and save the output to set the SLOT\_AUTH env var.
You can set this environment variable in CI, scripts, or deployment platforms to run slot without having to login.

### Create service deployments

```
slot deployments create <Project Name> katana
slot deployments create <Project Name> torii --world 0x3fa481f41522b90b3684ecfab7650c259a76387fab9c380b7a959e3d4ac69f
```

### Update a service

```
slot deployments update <Project Name> torii --version v0.3.5
```

### Delete a service

```
slot deployments delete <Project Name> torii
```

### Read service logs

```
slot deployments logs <Project Name> <katana | torii>
```

### List all deployments

```
slot deployments list
```

### View deployments configuration

```
slot deployments describe <Project Name> <katana | torii>
```

### View predeployed accounts

```
slot deployments accounts <Project Name> katana
```

### Manage collaborators with teams

The name of the team is the same as the project name used to create a service. A team is automatically created when you create a new project.

```
slot teams <Team Name> list
slot teams <Team Name> add <Account Name>
slot teams <Team Name> remove <Account Name>
```

### Fund teams

Teams need credits to run services and paymasters. You can fund teams using CLI commands or the web interface:

**CLI:**

```
slot auth fund
slot auth transfer <Team Name> --credits <amount>
```

**Web Interface:**
Navigate to `https://x.cartridge.gg/slot/fund` to fund teams through a user-friendly interface with credit card or crypto payments.

---
## Paymaster Management ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/slot/paymaster

Paymasters in Slot allow you to sponsor transaction fees for your applications, enabling gasless experiences for your users. The Cartridge Paymaster is a powerful feature that enables gasless transactions for your users, creating a more seamless Web3 experience. When enabled, the paymaster automatically covers transaction fees on behalf of your users, eliminating the need for them to hold ETH / STRK for gas fees. You can manage budgets, policies, and monitor usage through the Slot CLI.

## Availability

The paymaster service is available across all networks with different activation requirements:

* **Testnet Networks**
  + Automatically enabled, no additional setup required
* **Mainnet**
  + Available and fully self-served
  + Manage everything through the Slot CLI
  + Define your own usage scopes and spending limits

## Integration

One of the key benefits of the Cartridge Paymaster is that it requires zero additional integration work. When the paymaster is enabled for your application, it will automatically activate for all eligible transactions. No code changes or configuration are needed.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you are authenticated with Slot:

```
slot auth login
```

## Team Setup

Before creating a paymaster, you need a team with sufficient credits.

### Create a Team (if it doesn't exist)

```
slot teams <team-name> create --email <your-email@example.com>
```

### Fund Your Account and Transfer to Team

Paymasters automatically deduct from your team's account balance when created. If you don't have sufficient credits:

```
# Buy credits for your account (opens browser)
slot auth fund
```

1. Select the team you want to fund from the list
2. Choose your payment method (credit card or crypto)
3. Complete the purchase

## Creating a Paymaster

Create a new paymaster with an initial budget:

```
slot paymaster <paymaster-name> create --team <team-name> --budget <amount> --unit CREDIT
```

### Example

```
slot paymaster my-game-pm create --team my-team --budget 1000 --unit CREDIT
```

**Output:**

```
‚úÖ Paymaster Created Successfully
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

üè¢ Details:
  ‚Ä¢ Name: my-game-pm
  ‚Ä¢ Team: my-team

üí∞ Initial Budget:
  ‚Ä¢ Amount: 1000 CREDIT ($10.00 USD)
```

## Managing Budget

### Increase Budget

Add funds to your paymaster:

```
slot paymaster <paymaster-name> budget increase --amount <amount> --unit CREDIT
```

**Output:**

```
‚úÖ Budget Increased Successfully
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

üè¢ Paymaster: my-game-pm

üìà Operation:
  ‚Ä¢ Action: Increased
  ‚Ä¢ Amount: 500 CREDIT

üí∞ New Budget:
  ‚Ä¢ Amount: 1500 CREDIT ($15.00 USD)
```

### Decrease Budget

Remove funds from your paymaster:

```
slot paymaster <paymaster-name> budget decrease --amount <amount> --unit CREDIT
```

**Output:**

```
‚úÖ Budget Decreased Successfully
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

üè¢ Paymaster: my-game-pm

üìâ Operation:
  ‚Ä¢ Action: Decreased
  ‚Ä¢ Amount: 200 CREDIT

üí∞ New Budget:
  ‚Ä¢ Amount: 1300 CREDIT ($13.00 USD)
```

## Policy Management

Policies define which contracts and entry points your paymaster will sponsor.

### Add Policies from Preset (Recommended)

The preferred way to add policies is using verified contract presets for your games:

```
slot paymaster <paymaster-name> policy add-from-preset --name <preset-name>
```

**Example:**

```
slot paymaster my-game-pm policy add-from-preset --name dope-wars
```

### Add a Single Policy

## Dune Analytics Queries

Generate Dune Analytics queries to analyze your paymaster's transaction data:

```
slot paymaster <paymaster-name> dune [OPTIONS]
```

### Example Dashboard

See a live example of paymaster analytics at [Blob Arena Stats](https://dune.com/broody/blobert-arena-stats) on Dune Analytics.

### Query Types

**Fast Query (Default)**

```
slot paymaster my-game-pm dune
```

* Quick execution suitable for long time periods
* Matches direct execute\_from\_outside\_v3 calls and simple vRNG patterns
* Does not catch complex nested vRNG calls
* Best for initial analysis and long-term trends

**Exact Query**

```
slot paymaster my-game-pm dune --exact
```

* Exhaustive search of all transaction patterns
* Uses execute\_from\_outside\_v3 selector as anchor
* Catches all patterns including nested vRNG calls
* May timeout on long time periods
* Best for exact metrics

### Time Period Options

By default, queries use the paymaster's creation time. You can specify a custom time period:

```
# Last 24 hours
slot paymaster my-game-pm dune --last 24hr
 
# Last week
slot paymaster my-game-pm dune --last 1week
 
# Combine with exact query
slot paymaster my-game-pm dune --exact --last 24hr
```

**Time Period Options:**

* `1hr`, `2hr`, `24hr`
* `1day`, `2day`, `7day`
* `1week`

### Query Output

The command generates a SQL query that you can copy and run in Dune Analytics. The query includes:

* Daily transaction counts
* Unique user counts
* Fee amounts in USD
* Overall totals

### Quick Debugging Use Cases

The transaction history is useful for identifying issues:

**View expensive transactions that might indicate inefficient contract calls:**

```
slot paymaster my-game-pm transactions --order-by FEES_DESC --limit 10
```

**Investigate failed transactions to debug contract issues:**

```
slot paymaster my-game-pm transactions --filter REVERTED --last 24hr
```

## Best Practices

### Budget Management

* Start with a conservative budget and increase as needed
* Monitor spending through the stats command
* Keep sufficient team balance for paymaster operations

### Policy Management

* Be specific with your policies to avoid sponsoring unintended transactions
* **Use presets whenever possible** for verified game contracts in the Dojo ecosystem
* Contribute your game contracts to the preset repository for community verification
* Regularly review and update policies as your application evolves
* Test policies with small budgets before scaling up

### Security

* Only add policies for contracts you trust
* Keep your team membership limited to necessary collaborators

## Common Workflows

### Setting up a new game paymaster

```
# Create team if it doesn't exist
slot teams my-team create --email developer@mygame.com
 
# Fund your account and transfer to team
slot auth fund
slot auth transfer my-team --credit 100
 
# Create paymaster
slot paymaster my-game-pm create --team my-team --budget 1000 --unit CREDIT
 
# Add game contract policies
slot paymaster my-game-pm policy add --contract 0x123...abc --entrypoint move_player
slot paymaster my-game-pm policy add --contract 0x123...abc --entrypoint attack_enemy
slot paymaster my-game-pm policy add --contract 0x123...abc --entrypoint use_item
 
# Check initial setup
slot paymaster my-game-pm info
```

### Monitoring and maintenance

```
# Check daily stats
slot paymaster my-game-pm stats --last 24hr
 
# Check current status
slot paymaster my-game-pm info
 
# Add more budget if needed (ensure team has credits)
slot paymaster my-game-pm budget increase --amount 500 --unit CREDIT
```

### Insufficient Credits Error

If you encounter insufficient credits when creating or funding a paymaster:

```
# Check team balance first
slot teams my-team info
 
# Fund your account if needed
slot auth fund
 
# Transfer more credits to team
slot auth transfer my-team --credit 50
 
# Retry your paymaster operation
slot paymaster my-game-pm create --team my-team --budget 1000 --unit CREDIT
```

## Scale your deployments ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/slot/scale

Slot instances are launched with the `basic` instance by default. This instance type is only suitable for testing and
development purposes and comes with limited CPU & memory. 3 deployments of the basic tier are free.

To prepare your deployments for production, you can set up billing and upgrade to a paid instance tier.

## Instances

| Tier | Description | Storage | Old cost | Cost from July 1st |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic | First 3 are free. for dev & tests | 1GB | $3/month | $10/month |
| Common | (removed) | auto | $15/month | ‚Äì |
| Pro | 2 vCPU and 4GB RAM | auto | - | $50/month |
| Epic | 4 vCPU and 8GB RAM | auto | $15/month | $100/month |
| Legendary | 8 vCPU and 16GB RAM | auto | $35/month | $200/month |
| Insane | (removed) | auto | $50/month | - |

Note: basic instances are scaled down automatically after a few hours of no activity. To revive deployments, simply send a single request to the instance URL, and it'll be revived on the spot. If unused without any activity for more than 30 days, it will get deleted.

### Premium tiers

Pro and higher tiers are never scaled down or deleted as long as there are enough credits on the related team.
They also come with auto storage scaling, which means your deployment can never run out of disk space.

Storage is billed at $0.20/GB/month.

## Replicas

For torii, with premium tiers, you can choose to deploy your instances with multiple replicas using the `--replicas <n>` flag.

```
slot d create --tier epic my-project torii --replicas 3
```

Replicas are billed as how many replicas you have. For example, if you have 3 replicas, you will be billed 3 times the monthly cost of the tier you are using.

## Regions

For torii, with premium tiers, you can choose to deploy your instances in multiple regions.

| Region |
| --- |
| `us-east` |
| `europe-west` |
| `asia-southeast` |

To deploy a slot service in multiple regions, you can use the `--regions` flag.

Katana is only supported in `us-east` at this time.

```
slot d create --tier pro my-project torii --regions us-east,asia-southeast,europe-west
```

Multi-region deployments are billed based on the number of regions you choose and the tier you are using by multiplying the monthly cost of the tier by the number of regions times replicas. For example, if you have two replicas in three regions, you will be billed six times the monthly cost of the tier you are using.

## Set up billing

To set up slot billing, you need to buy credits and transfer them to a slot team.

If you have existing deployments, a team of the same name as your account will be created for you, and you can transfer credits to it.

```
slot teams my-team create --email my-email@example.com # email is required for billing alerts
slot teams my-team update --email my-email@example.com # if you want to update an existing team's email
 
slot auth fund # buy credits for your account, this opens the browser
 
slot auth transfer my-team --usd 10 # transfer $10 from your controller to my-team
# or
slot auth transfer my-team --credits 1000 # transfer 1000 credits ($10) from your controller to my-team
```

Once you create paid slot instances, funds are deducted on a daily basic with a minimum charge of one day. For example, if you create a deployment and delete it after one hour, you will be charged 1/30th of the monthly cost.

## Create an instance with a paid tier

Make sure to use the team flag of the team you previously transferred credits to.

```
slot d create --tier epic --team my-team my-instance torii
```

## Update an existing instance to a paid tier

Note that you can only upgrade tiers; downgrading to a lower tier is not possible.

Make sure that you created this instance with the team flag of the team you previously transferred credits to, or make sure the team it belongs to has credits available.

```
slot d update --tier epic my-instance torii
```

## vRNG Overview ‚Äì Cartridge Documentation

**Source:** https://docs.cartridge.gg/slot/vrng

This Cartridge Verifiable Random Number Generator (vRNG) is designed to provide cheap, atomic verifiable randomness for fully onchain games.

## Key Features

1. **Atomic Execution**: The vRNG request and response are processed within the same transaction, ensuring synchronous and immediate randomness for games.
2. **Efficient Onchain Verification**: Utilizes the Stark curve and Poseidon hash for optimized verification on Starknet.
3. **Fully Onchain**: The entire vRNG process occurs onchain, maintaining transparency and verifiability.
4. **Improved Player Experience**: The synchronous nature of the vRNG allows for instant resolution of random events in games, enhancing gameplay fluidity.

## How It Works

1. A game calls `request_random(caller, source)` as the first call in their multicall.
2. A game contract calls `consume_random(source)` on the vRNG contract.
3. The vRNG server generates a random value using the vRNG algorithm for the provided entropy source.
4. The Cartridge Paymaster wraps the players multicall with a `submit_random` and `assert_consumed` call.
5. The `submit_random` call submit a vRNG Proof for the request, the vRNG Proof is verified onchain, ensuring the integrity of the random value which is immediately available and must be used within the same transaction.
6. The `assert_consumed` call ensures that `consume_random(source)` has been called, it also reset the storage used to store the random value during the transaction to 0.

## Benefits for Game Developers

* **Simplicity**: Easy integration with existing Starknet smart contracts and Dojo.
* **Performance**: Synchronous randomness generation without waiting for multiple transactions.
* **Cost-effectiveness**: Potential cost savings through Paymaster integration.
* **Security**: Cryptographically secure randomness that's fully verifiable onchain.

For detailed implementation and usage, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/vrf).

## Using the vRNG Provider

To integrate the Verifiable Random Function (vRNG) into your Starknet contract, follow these steps:

1. Define the vRNG Provider interface:

```
#[starknet::interface]
trait IVrfProvider<TContractState> {
    fn request_random(self: @TContractState, caller: ContractAddress, source: Source);
    fn consume_random(ref self: TContractState, source: Source) -> felt252;
}
 
#[derive(Drop, Copy, Clone, Serde)]
pub enum Source {
    Nonce: ContractAddress,
    Salt: felt252,
}
```

2. Define the vRNG Provider address in your contract:

```
const VRF_PROVIDER_ADDRESS: starknet::ContractAddress = starknet::contract_address_const::<0x123>();
```

3. Create a dispatcher for the vRNG Provider:

```
let vrf_provider = IVrfProviderDispatcher { contract_address: VRF_PROVIDER_ADDRESS };
```

4. To consume random values, use the following pattern in your contract functions:

```
fn roll_dice(ref self: ContractState) {
    // Your game logic here...
 
    // Consume random value
    let player_id = get_caller_address();
    let random_value = vrf_provider.consume_random(Source::Nonce(player_id));
 
    // Use the random value in your game logic
    // ...
}
```

5. You can use either `Source::Nonce(ContractAddress)` or `Source::Salt(felt252)` as the source for randomness:

   * `Source::Nonce(ContractAddress)`: Uses the provided contract address internal nonce for randomness.   
     Each request will generate a different seed ensuring unique random values.
   * `Source::Salt(felt252)`: Uses a provided salt value for randomness.   
     Two requests with same salts will result in same random value.

## Executing vRNG transactions

In order to execute a transaction that includes a `consume_random` call, you need to include a `request_random` transaction as the first transaction in the multicall. The `request_random` call allows our server to efficiently parse transactions that include a `consume_random` call internally.

```
const call = await account.execute([
  // Prefix the multicall with the request_random call
  {
    contractAddress: VRF_PROVIDER_ADDRESS,
    entrypoint: 'request_random',
    calldata: CallData.compile({
      caller: GAME_CONTRACT,
      // Using Source::Nonce(address)
      source: {type: 0, address: account.address},
      // Using Source::Salt(felt252)
      // source: {type: 1, salt: 0x123}
    }),
  },
  {
    contractAddress: GAME_CONTRACT,
    entrypoint: 'roll_dice',
  },
]);
```

**Ensure that you call `consume_random` with the same `Source` as used in `request_random`.**

### Important: Adding vRNG to Policies

When using the Cartridge Controller with vRNG, make sure to add the vRNG contract address and the `request_random` method to your policies. This allows the controller to pre-approve vRNG-related transactions, ensuring a seamless experience for your users.

Add the following policy to your existing policies:

```
const policies: Policy[] = [
  // ... your existing policies ...
  {
    target: VRF_PROVIDER_ADDRESS,
    method: "request_random",
    description: "Allows requesting random numbers from the VRF provider",
  },
];
```

This ensures that vRNG-related transactions can be executed without requiring additional user approval each time.

By following these steps, you can integrate the vRNG Provider into your Starknet contract and generate verifiable random
numbers for your onchain game or application.

## Security Assumptions

During the Phase 0 deployment, the construction assumes the Provider has not revealed the private key and does not collude with players.

In the future, we plan to move the Provider to a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in order to provide a more robust security model without compromising on performance.
