## Introduction | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net

Gaming has transformed dramatically over the last decades, driven by technological advancements that redefine player interactions and immersive experiences. Today, three main methods dominate gaming consumption:

* **Mobile Gaming:** Easy development and widespread access, but limited by hardware constraints and app download friction.
* **Console / PC Gaming:** Premium graphics and high performance, but requires costly hardware, significant downloads, and lengthy installations.
* **WebGL Gaming:** Instant access via browsers without installations, yet struggles with optimization and performance across various devices.

Each of these models comes with trade-offs that force developers to balance accessibility, quality, and cost efficiency.

### **Pixel Streaming‚ÄîThe Game Changer**

Pixel streaming‚Äîcommonly known as cloud gaming‚Äîeliminates hardware barriers completely, enabling AAA games to run instantly and seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and browsers.

Our vision: pixel streaming will soon become the **standard across all gaming platforms**, due to its unique capabilities:

* **Cross-Device Compatibility:** High-quality gameplay instantly delivered to any device, without installation or compatibility concerns, significantly increasing accessibility and developer reach.
* **Cross-Channel Integration:** Games easily embedded into social media (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook), e-commerce sites (Amazon), and apps, multiplying touchpoints for user engagement.
* **Superior Delivery:** Console-level performance independent of local hardware limitations, ensuring smooth user experiences with seamless transitions across devices.

This revolutionary approach allows websites, apps, and platforms to independently serve sophisticated, interactive content, reshaping digital strategies for content creators, brands, and game studios alike.

Beyond gaming, pixel streaming is poised to accelerate the Open Metaverse, enabling instant global delivery of immersive content without dependency on specialized client hardware‚Äîbringing digital twins, virtual real estate tours, personalized AI interactions, and interactive episodic experiences to life instantly.

### **The Centralization Problem**

Yet, despite its promise, pixel streaming faces a major bottleneck: centralized infrastructure. Current cloud GPU solutions rely heavily on costly, inefficient, and environmentally unsustainable data centers. Massive investments in cooling, maintenance, and continuous hardware upgrades drive soaring operational costs and significant carbon emissions. A handful of technology giants hold near-total control, limiting accessibility and stifling innovation.

Simultaneously, GPU computational power underpins critical advancements‚Äîfrom AI and robotics to cloud gaming and the emerging Metaverse. Demand is exploding, but traditional centralized models simply cannot scale efficiently or sustainably.

Notably, **50‚Äì75% of global GPU capacity currently remains idle in consumer devices**‚Äîan untapped resource representing a vast pool of computational power. Leveraging this idle capacity could effectively double available GPU resources worldwide, providing a highly scalable and cost-effective solution.

### **Why Decentralization Is the Future**

Cloud gaming is the perfect candidate for blockchain-enabled decentralization. Unlike AI training or batch processing (which tolerate centralized infrastructure constraints), cloud gaming requires:

* **Ultra-low latency**
* **High availability**
* **Flexible scalability**

Traditional cloud providers struggle with these critical requirements.

YOM‚Äôs peer-to-peer cloud gaming network flips the script, utilizing the untapped GPU power of household gaming rigs and consumer-grade PCs. It offers a purely serverless pixel-streaming model‚Äîeliminating the need for centralized data centers altogether.

This innovative decentralized approach offers clear advantages:

* **Drastic Cost Reduction:** Eliminating capital expenditures (CAPEX) entirely and significantly reducing operational expenditures (OPEX), bringing costs from typical $1‚Äì2/hour down to ~$0.10/hour.
* **Global Reach, Local Performance:** Decentralized architectures naturally expand globally while providing localized connectivity‚Äîdelivering ultra-low latency (sub-30 ms) and exceptional user experiences.
* **Economic & Environmental Liberation:** Transferring power from large centralized cloud providers back to gamers and hardware owners, while significantly reducing environmental impact by recycling existing GPU resources.

## Infrastructure | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/infrastructure

YOM‚Äôs architecture is purpose-built for decentralized, high-performance cloud gaming. It combines a custom pixel streaming solution, secure edge computing, and intelligent decentralized orchestration to deliver interactive streaming with near-local responsiveness and reliability.

The platform spans from a proprietary pixel streaming services and developer SDKs to the underlying network of trusted GPU nodes coordinated by an AI-driven scheduler. Together, these components enable any AAA game to be streamed instantly to any device with sub-40‚ÄØms latency, high reliability (through rapid failover), and end-to-end security ‚Äì all at a fraction of the cost of traditional cloud gaming.

### **1.** Peer-to-Peer Pixel Streaming

YOM has developed its own lightweight pixel-streaming service that runs games on remote consumer-grade GPUs and streams the video feed back to players via WebRTC for minimal latency.

Once a session is approved, the gameplay is delivered over a direct peer-to-peer connection between the node and the player‚Äôs device.

YOM‚Äôs streaming protocol establishes an encrypted video/audio stream and input channel without routing through any central server, minimizing latency by eliminating extra hops. Game audio/video and player input data are end-to-end encrypted, so the content remains private and secure even if it traverses relays or public networks.

### **2. AI-Powered Orchestration**

Workload allocation across the YOM network is handled by HyperOrch, YOM‚Äôs decentralized orchestration engine.

HyperOrch continuously gathers telemetry from each node ‚Äì a multi-dimensional ‚Äúcapability vector‚Äù including available GPU/CPU capacity, memory, bandwidth, encoder load, thermal headroom, and more. Similarly, each game title is characterized by a resource footprint profile (GPU demand, memory needs, expected bitrate, etc.).

Using these inputs, HyperOrch‚Äôs AI-driven scheduler predicts the expected performance (e.g. framerate) for a given game on each candidate node and dynamically matches players to the optimal node in real time. Unlike naive approaches that just pick the nearest server, HyperOrch filters and ranks nodes by multiple criteria (player-to-node latency, hardware suitability for the game, current load, etc.) to find a host that can deliver smooth 60+ FPS and <40‚ÄØms ping for that session.

The orchestrator even learns from each session: it updates its model with actual performance outcomes, continuously improving placement decisions over time. This intelligent scheduling maximizes network-wide performance and efficiency ‚Äì avoiding bad host-game pairings that might lag, fully utilizing available GPU headroom, and reducing costs by optimally balancing the load on community nodes.

In practical terms, HyperOrch‚Äôs real-time decision-making ensures each player is connected to a node that will give them a console-quality experience, and it can proactively migrate or redistribute sessions if a better match becomes available.

### 2. Developer SDKs

The YOM Player Integration Library lets you embed live YOM game streams in any web property via **two approaches**:

Method

Use Case

Key Benefit

**Basic Embed**

One-off landing pages, quick demos

Copy-and-paste `<iframe>`

**Custom UI Embed**

Full-fledged portals, dynamic controls

Script-based API + UI state manager

Both methods handle secure messaging between your page and the YOM Player, manage UI transitions, and expose an event/command API.

YOM provides optional Unreal Engine and Unity SDKs that integrate the streaming service seamlessly into their games. These SDKs let developers incorporate responsive HUD overlays, site widgets that can communicate directly with the stream, and custom authentication or monetization flows to tailor the player experience.

### 3. Node OS

The nodes boot a minimal, read‚Äëonly Linux image. On first launch the operating system:

* **Auto‚Äëdetects hardware & installs signed GPU drivers** so the discrete card is exposed at full performance (no user intervention required).
* Runs a **registration module** that authenticates the user, measures uplink bandwidth, RTT to regional probes, idle GPU capacity, and temperature; it then publishes this capability vector to the discovery ledger for HyperOrch scheduling.
* Provides an isolated execution sandbox that mounts each game image read‚Äëonly, passes the GPU through exclusively.

During gameplay the OS reports live telemetry (FPS, 95‚Äëth percentile latency, thermals); if thresholds are exceeded it can dynamically down‚Äëclock the game container or request HyperOrch migration. On shutdown‚Äîor if the boot drive is removed‚Äîthe OS triggers a **rollback routine** that asserts a PCIe reset, DMA‚Äëscrubs RAM and VRAM, clears any drive keys, and reboots, ensuring no player data or studio IP persists. Updates follow an atomic A/B scheme: a new signed image is written to the inactive slot and only activated after signature verification and checksum pass, with automatic rollback on failure.

### 4.‚ÄØ**Decentralized Discovery & Attestation**

Nodes publish signed availability records (location hash, GPU class, live load) to a *distributed hash table / on‚Äëchain registry*. Clients query the same ledger, pick candidates within a latency radius, then request the node‚Äôs latest attestation. If the proof checks out the client proceeds; if not, the node is black‚Äëlisted until it re‚Äëestablishes trust. This **serverless matchmaking** eliminates single points of failure and allows the network to scale organically while remaining secure.

### 5.‚ÄØ**Node & Stream Management Portal**

Operators and studios manage everything through a secure web dashboard. **Node owners** view uptime, earned‚ÄØrewards, temperature metrics, and update status; they can schedule maintenance windows or toggle delegated hosting. **Publishers** upload and manage builds, set session budgets, and track live QoE metrics (latency heat‚Äëmaps, FPS histograms).

## Node Reputation | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/node-reputation

XP serves as a soul-bound metric in the YOM ecosystem, meaning it is permanently tied to each user‚Äôs unique identity and cannot be traded or transferred. XP rankings appear on both short-term (weekly or monthly) and all-time leaderboards. This dual display encourages fresh participants to climb the ranks while acknowledging veteran members for their longstanding dedication. Here are some of the benefit of high XP:

1. **Enhanced Node Rewards**
   The more XP a node operator has, the higher their position on the operator leaderboard. This can translate into increased session allocations or bonus multipliers for node earnings.
2. **Airdrops & Exclusive Perks**
   High-ranking XP holders periodically receive **$YOM drops** or discounted access to partner programs. They may also enjoy early access to premium features, events, or beta releases within the YOM ecosystem.
3. **Governance Influence**

   * **Voting Power:** While holding $YOM typically grants voting rights, XP acts as a **multiplier**‚Äîthe most engaged and knowledgeable community members gain proportionally greater voting weight.
   * **Proposal Privileges:** Certain high-XP brackets may unlock the ability to propose major changes or direct resource allocation in the DAO, guiding crucial development decisions.
4. **Social Recognition**
   Exclusive badges and titles‚Äîdisplayed within the YOM dApp, community forums, and in-game environments‚Äîhelp top XP earners stand out. These digital ‚Äústatus symbols‚Äù showcase trustworthiness and expertise to other users.

### How to earn XP?

The YOM dApp and [Discord](https://discord.gg/MwdDRdmZ) facilitate easy access for members to participate in activities where they can earn XP, enhancing their engagement and influence within the YOM community. Core earning avenues are:

1. **Holding $YOM**
   Simply by holding $YOM, your wallets accrues XP.
2. **Node Operation & Reliability**
   Node owners who run stable, high-uptime machines accumulate XP in proportion to the reliability and performance of their nodes. This ensures that those contributing critical infrastructure earn corresponding reputation points.
3. **Community Engagement & Content Creation**
   Active Discord or forum participation, creation of high-quality guides or tutorials, and social media advocacy all generate XP. This mechanism rewards both the technical and cultural contributors who help grow and educate the community.
4. **DAO Participation & Governance**

   Authors of successful proposals‚Äîthose that pass and benefit the platform‚Äîgain additional XP whilst regular, informed voting on proposals further builds a user‚Äôs reputation in the community.
5. **Mod/Peer Voting & Seasonal Challenges:** Periodic events hosted by the YOM Foundation or community-driven committees can offer bonus XP for tasks like stress-testing new features or helping onboard new members. Certain XP awards are distributed through peer recognition, where outstanding contributions or helpful community moderation receive upvotes or endorsements from other members.

## Tokenomics | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/tokenomics

The $YOM token is the economic linchpin of the network, with its deflationary model and reward dynamics carefully designed to balance short-term incentives (node rewards, studio growth) with long-term scarcity (5% burn on each transaction).

## Medium of Exchange

$YOM serves as the primary currency for accessing and operating cloud gaming sessions. Studios, brands, and broadcasters purchase $YOM to power these streams, creating a continuous demand tied directly to network usage.

Node operators who contribute GPU resources are paid in $YOM, ensuring that high-performance nodes with greater uptime and reliability capture higher earnings. This token-based reward model fuels a self-sustaining cycle: more users and games ‚Üí more sessions ‚Üí more demand for $YOM.

#### **It's Network Fuel**

The token has a strict deflationary structure: no new tokens can ever be minted. Instead, Whenever someone plays a game on the network, a percentage (5%) of the network rewards are burned. Since every purchase of $YOM directly eliminates a portion of tokens from the market, the float becomes scarcer over time. This design boost long-term token value whilst aligning token holders with network usage.

#### **Liquidity Provision**

While node operation is a key earning avenue, community members can also use $YOM to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. These activities not only secure the network and facilitate smooth token trading, but also offer participants a passive way to accrue additional rewards.

## Flow of Value

Publishers utilize $YOM tokens to pay node operators for running the sessions. The payment usually starts as a recurring FIAT payment, which gets automatically swapped into $YOM. Below is the distribution key:

Stakeholder

Distribution %

Description

**Nodes**

40

The majority of the rewards go directly to node operators to incentivize their participation and ensure high uptime and performance.

**Network**

55

Funds allocated to infrastructure improvements, software updates and scaling operations.

**Burned**

5

This mechanism keeps the token supply deflationary, aligning all stakeholders.

As node operators receive $YOM, some choose to hold to accumulate more XP, become active in the DAO, or provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges, further fueling the network‚Äôs growth and liquidity. Others may convert tokens to cover operational costs.

## DAO | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/dao

A key pillar of our mission towards decentralization is the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which coordinates decision-making processes on-chain and in democratic fashion.

The DAO is tasked with overseeing the network‚Äôs foundational governance and long-term vision. Representing the DAO is the YOM Foundation is a non-profit entity.

## Decision-Making

The primary layer of governance influence is embedded within XP (Experience Points). The higher a participant‚Äôs XP, the more weight their votes carry, ensuring that engaged contributors who have demonstrated consistent, positive impact in the ecosystem shape its evolution.

All major decisions, including votes, funding distributions, and policy changes, are recorded on-chain. This transparent ledger reinforces accountability and ensures that any community member can audit the decision-making process at any time. The DAO manages:

* **Protocol:** Anything that impacts the network at large, such as security standards, advertising guidelines, and core protocol updates.
* **Tokenomics:** Any change to burn rates, reward structures, or additional deflationary mechanisms must be vetted and approved by the DAO.
* **Infrastructure:** Key updates to the underlying protocol, such as improved node benchmarking or new streaming standards, are decided collectively.
* **Budgeting:** A dedicated treasury, supports grants, development incentives, ecosystem programs (BUILD/EARN), and other community-led initiatives.
* **Moderation:** DAO-elected moderators ensure content alignment with broader ecosystem goals and uphold community standards.

Over time, more aspects of YOM‚Äôs operations will migrate on-chain, from resource allocation in ecosystem programs to deeper integration of node management. This shift aims to minimize central points of failure and consolidate community ownership. Initiatives will increasingly rely on DAO proposals and votes to select and fund recipients. This progressive handover of program administration‚Äîfrom Foundation-led to entirely community-driven‚Äîfurther empowers the network‚Äôs most active members.

As the platform matures, a series of transparent milestones will detail how specific powers, assets, and policy controls are transferred from the Foundation to the DAO. The ultimate goal is to establish a completely trustless, self-governing environment in which all critical decisions emerge from community consensus and aligned economic incentives.

YOM‚Äôs governance model harnesses the collective wisdom of its community, elevates committed contributors through XP-based weighting, and grants creators and users the autonomy to shape their own experiences. With a measured transition toward full decentralization, YOM ensures that no single entity holds disproportionate power, sustaining a balanced, community-led ecosystem for the long term.

## DAO Limitations

Within the framework of DAO-approved standards, studios and content creators maintain full autonomy. Only content that contravenes essential DAO policies, such as those related to user safety, or malicious behavior faces moderation or revocation of streaming privileges.

## Overview | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/overview

This guide introduces best practices for integrating the YOM SDK with your game, enabling seamless connection between your stream and web technologies.

Developing for YOM differs from traditional projects. Each stream exists on a webpage, instantly accessible from any device. This approach necessitates avoiding loading screens and complex UI in favor of instant, holistic, integral game design. This new methodology requires considering:

* Designing with "responsiveness" and "instant gameplay" in mind
* Debugging with web servers rather than just in UE5 viewports
* Bi-directional game-to-web communication
* Web Widgets and Analytics

## Why Build on YOM?

#### Rapid Game Deployment

* Both multiplayer and singleplayer.
* Focus on core AAA+ experiences, not menus

#### Cross-Platform Reach

* Target large audiences via device-independent compatibility
* Easy embedding in websites and platforms
* Affordable & scalable DePIN hosting

#### Integrate Everything

* Seamlessly integrate external data sources & events
* Native tag manager integration for analytics

#### Customization / White-label

* White-label user journeys from login to stream
* Integrate custom web widget support for enhanced interactivity
* Manage admin accounts to trigger in-game events

## Integration

The integration SDK includesa simple Node.js web server referencing a sample HTML + JS implementation. When launching a stream via the YOM Toolbar in UE5, you can optionally start your preferred web server, allowing local debugging of the entire user journey.

We provide a JS library that enables integration and full customization of the stream experience, from authentication to deployment and execution. We provide functionalities like callbacks and multi-stream capabilities for effective control over stream and authentication processes.

Figure 1: illustrates our reference HTML implementation demonstrating authentication (included with SDK)

## Stream Embed

Post-authentication, the embedded stream loads as an iFrame, spawning the player and [hiding certain components](/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/dynamic-layouts). The stream automatically scales across aspect ratios while maintaining resolution quality. Test this in the reference implementation by resizing horizontally (desktop) or vertically (mobile).

Figure 2: showcases a sample web widget and the stream with an expanded modal.

To accommodate limited user attention, especially for web-based streams, we utilize a simple, customizable modal that loads post-launching/spawning and its visibility can be managed via the SDK. This allows focus on game development while minimizing overhead and time spent on UI.

The modal includes a "God-mode" option, accessible via a password in the login field. This feature enables real-time in-game event execution without building web components, facilitating testing and script execution. God-mode benefits both developers and moderators, enabling efficient game management and testing.

Figure 3: demonstrates the "God-mode" interface, displaying custom functions registered via the SDK.

## Getting Started | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started

The GETTING STARTED section provides a comprehensive guide on how to properly set up and deliver your project to ensure compatibility with the YOM build pipeline.

To create your first experience, you need to broadly follow these steps:

1. Create a new or open an existing project.
2. Import the [UE5 SDK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mv0RNi9jmkz9L3PJWQnSu5ey-2IJek1B?usp=drive_link) in your project.
3. Test and debug your experience locally until it runs perfectly.
4. Build and then publish your experience via the [app](https://app.yom.ooo/).
5. Integrate your experience on your website with a single line of code.

## A Checklist Before Starting (!):

* If you are opting to use YOM within an existing Unreal Engine project, please check the **Linux support for existing plugins**. If your plugin does not officially support compile to Linux, in most cases it still compiles to Linux and if not on the first try, the fix is usually very simple.
* For multiplayer support you need to download and use the [source version](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/BuildingUnrealEngine/) of Unreal Engine.
* You need to install [visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to build the headers for the SDK and you need the correct [clang](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3) for Linux in order to build the game locally. Install the cross-compile toolchain that you can find on the bottom of the page.
* Ensure you use an NVIDIA 2070 RTX or higher for your development machine. This ensures you optimize your game for our network and get the best graphics and experience out of your game.

## Custom Authentication | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/custom-authentication

You can define your own custom functions to validate user input on button click. To achieve this add `data-callback="{someFunction}"` to the launch button. Then define your custom function in a JS file that accepts two parameters: `onSuccess, onFailure`.

#### Example

We have as an example the following HTML elements:

Copy

```
<input type="text" id="yomInput" placeholder="your name" autofocus>
<input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter password">
<button type="submit" data-callback="validatePassword" id="yomLaunch-1">start the experience</button>
```

In the following example function we perform simple front-end validation to match the data-`callback="validatePassword"`attribute defined in the `yomLaunch-1` button:

Copy

```
function validatePassword(onSuccess, onFailure) {
    const passwordInput = document.getElementById('password');
    const enteredPassword = passwordInput.value;
    const hardcodedPassword = 'secure123';  // This is the hardcoded password

    if (enteredPassword === hardcodedPassword) {
        onSuccess();  // Call the success callback if the password is correct
    } else {
        onFailure();  // Call the failure callback if the password is incorrect
    }
}
```

## Event Handling | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/event-handling

With YOM you can build custom web widgets that communicate directly with the stream via the `postToYOM` function:

Copy

```
postToYOM('AdjustSetting', {settingValue: 'newValue'});
```

This function facilitates sending commands or adjustments to the stream. Do ensure you [register events](/build/ue5/registering-events) inside of your game project, to bind the events to certain functions.

#### Example

We assume you have 3 buttons on your webpage (`#spawnBot`, `#removeBot`, `#clearBot`). On click we can trigger content within the stream using the `postToYOM` function:

Copy

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    document.getElementById('spawnBot').addEventListener('click', function() {
        postToYOM('SpawnBot', {amount: '1'});
    });

    document.getElementById('removeBot').addEventListener('click', function() {
        postToYOM('RemoveBot', {amount: '1'});
    });

    document.getElementById('clearBot').addEventListener('click', function() {
        postToYOM('ClearBot', {});
    });
});
```

### Listen for Events

Using YOM SDK you can push events from the game to the web browser. From there you can connect your own logic to it.

YOM SDK can [automatically push](/build/ue5/push-events) events to the data layer for GTM and GA integration. Configure your GTM to capture these events for detailed interaction tracking.

## Multi-Stream Setup | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/multi-stream-setup

YOM Core supports multiple streams on a single page, enabling rich, interactive webpages that can act as content aggregators.

* Create multiple stream containers:

Copy

```
<div id="yomTarget-1" data-streamurl="${STREAM_URL_1}"></div>
<div id="yomTarget-2" data-streamurl="${STREAM_URL_2}"></div>
```

* Add corresponding input fields and launch buttons:

Copy

```
<input type="text" id="yomInput-1" placeholder="Name for Stream 1">
<button id="yomLaunch-1">Start Stream 1</button>

<input type="text" id="yomInput-2" placeholder="Name for Stream 2">
<button id="yomLaunch-2">Start Stream 2</button>
```

* Build widgets for independent streams:

Copy

```
const targetId = '2'; // assuming we want to post to stream 2
postToYOM(targetId, 'AdjustSetting', {settingValue: 'newValue'});
```

## Dynamic Layouts | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/dynamic-layouts

To dynamically toggle element visibility in response to stream interaction, you can directly utilize the `.toggle-on-yom-{targetId}`:

Copy

```
<div class="additional-info toggle-on-yom-1">
    Information that should show after a user joins the stream.
</div>
```

If you want to apply custom css, you can use the `data-hook` to associate specific UI elements with the stream, allowing for broader layout adjustments when the stream is activated or deactivated:

Copy

```
<div id="yomTarget-1" data-hook="#{somediv}" data-streamurl="${STREAM_URL}"></div>
```

## UE5 | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5

## Step 1: Use a C++ UE5 Project

You need to use a C++ version of an UE5 project. This can be achieved by setting up a new project and selecting C++ as the project defaults or by converting your existing blueprint project to C++. There is no disadvantage for picking C++ over Blueprints as you can still use Blueprints throughout your project.

If you are converting from an existing project follow the following steps to convert it to a C++ project:

* Click Tools -> select "new C++ class"
* Select none as the parent class and press next.
* Press create and it will convert your Blueprint project to a C++ project.

## Step 2: Add the SDK to the project

To incorporate the necessary SDK into your project, follow these steps:

* Close your project if you opened it as part of the previous step.
* Navigate to your root project folder and create a new folder called "Plugins". This folder will serve as the container for the required plugins.
* Obtain the YOM UE5 SDK for your Unreal Engine version from the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mv0RNi9jmkz9L3PJWQnSu5ey-2IJek1B?usp=sharing). If you don't have access, ask your YOM contact person. This will trigger a download of a ZIP file. The ZIP file will contain three plugins.
* Extract the zip file and copy and paste the three plugins into the "Plugins" folder you need to create in your project directory. Ensure that the plugins are directly placed inside the "Plugins" folder and not within any additional subfolders.

### Result

By following the steps outlined above, you should now have a folder structure resembling the following:

Copy

```
- YourProject
  - Plugins
    - YOM
    - GltfRuntime
    - VaRest
```

## Step 3: Building the SDK

Now that everything is set, boot your project and compile the plugin headers. This need to be done once every time you update the SDK or add any other plugin and requires using a C++ project with [Visual Studio](/build/getting-started#checklist-before-you-start) installed. After it is set, it will automatically open the project.

Opening the project for the first time can take a bit of time. Just be patient. It will boot.

## Configure your Stream | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/configure-your-stream

This page will explain how to set up your game to work with the features present in the YOM UE5 SDK and assumes a new project. For existing projects, you may already have modified the GameMode and PlayerController classes. To retain compatibility follow the following guide.

### Step 1: Validate the SDK

YOM SDK should be enabled by default. Validate by checking if a new toolbar appeared in your navigation bar called 'YOM Toolbar'.

#### Follow these steps if the toolbar did not appear:

* Click on "Edit" and select "Plugins" from the dropdown menu. This will open the Plugins window.
* In the search bar within the Plugins window, type 'YOM' to search for the YOM Replicator SDK plugin.
* Enable it. If the plugin does not appear, try restarting the editor and repeat this step.
* Do the same for GltfRuntime and VaRest plugins in the same manner and enable them by clicking their respective checkboxes.
* After enabling the plugins, it is recommended to restart the editor. This allows Unreal to load the plugins properly.

### Step 2: Setting up the SDK

To configure the YOM Replicator SDK for your metaverse project, follow these steps:

1. Open the setup screen by navigating to "Tools" in the top menu. Select "YOM" and then choose "Setup Project." This will open the setup window.

1. In the setup window, you will find several settings that need to be configured. Here is an explanation of each setting:

* **Startup World**: This setting sets the startup level. When we make a build this will be the starting point. As example it can be a mainmenu or if you don't have that the scene the game begins
* **Game World**: This setting sets the game level. This is the level where the game takes place.
* **Player Asset**: This setting defines the asset that players will control within the world. It can be any character or object that allows player interaction. The default character provided by the YOM plugin is the Yom\_BP\_ThirdPersonCharacter. Change it from "None" to "Yom\_BP\_ThirdPersonCharacter".
* **Playercontroller asset:** The Playercontroller that is used the game world or you want to use in the game world.
* **GameMode asset**: The GameMode that is used the game world or you want to use in the game world.
* **Webserver path**: The path to the webserver you want to use. We already profite a example webserver.
* **Multiplayer project**: If enabled, this setting allows the code from the SDK to be multiplayer. Enable this if you creating a game for multiplayer
* **Voice Chat**: If enabled, this setting allows players to communicate with each other through voice chat within the experience.

Click "Begin Setup," and if the settings are correctly configured, a message will appear in the bottom right corner, instructing you to restart the editor. Click "Restart" to apply the changes.

In case you want to make any further adjustments or verify the setup, you can run the setup tool again or manually modify the settings.

Validate your configuration

After restarting, navigate to Content Drawer -> Content. You should now see a MetaspaceGameMode and a MetaspacePlayer. These assets can be used or extended to add further modifications and behavior to your experience. Then navigate to Settings -> World Settings, then validate the GameMode as shown in the provided screenshot.

*Note that the Default Pawn Class in the MetaspaceGameMode is intentionally set to None, as the pawn will be loaded into the game via the MetaspacePlayer.*

## Test your Stream | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/test-your-stream

To test your game locally you can do this in three ways:

1. **Stream to localhost:8888.** This allows you to debug the full web experience, including player authentication. This is the default setting with all toggled turned off and is also the recommended setting to playtest the full experience.
2. **Play it in viewport.** If you want to quickly debug locally and you want to bypass the authentication window, you can opt for testing in the viewport. To enable this you need to toggle on 'Run in Editor' and 'Auto Spawn Player'.
3. **Play in stand****a****lone.** If you want to debug networking features without needing to first pass the authentication window in the web browser, you need to toggle on 'Auto Spawn Player'.

## Toolbar

For these things we made the YOM Toolbar to easily test your game. We added some settings to help you test your game:

* **Launch Game.** Launches the game with the below settings.
* **Run in Editor.** When turned off it runs the game in stand alone and starts the signaling server. When turned on it will run the game in viewport and not start the signaling server.
* **Respawn Player.** When turned off it runs the game in stand alone and starts the signaling server. When turned on it will run the game in viewport and not start the signaling server.
* **Auto Connect Player:** When turned on it will execute the connect logic as you would connect from the pixelstreamer
* **Run Webserver:** When turned on it will start the webserver when we press launch game
* **Run Webclient:** When turned on it will start the webclient when we press launch game
* **Force Authentication.** When true, if forces users to authenticate with their wallet else it will not work.
* **Number of Clients.** You can select the number of clients it needs to boot up. It will also boot up another signalling server. You can connect to it by adding a port. 8888 is the first one second 8889 etc.

The YOM Toolbar it to make it easy to test locally. You can still use the default buttons to play the game and the settings will apply to it.

## Result

Pressing the Launch Stream button, the servers and games will boot and you can debug your game within a webpage. Make sure to add a Player Start to the level if the character does not spawn automatically.

## Responsive Design | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/responsive-design

In the era of multi-device gaming, it's crucial to ensure your game is accessible and optimized for various platforms, including mobile devices and tablets. While YOM uses pixel streaming to deliver high-quality graphics across devices, understanding and adapting to different screen sizes and input methods can greatly enhance the user experience. Why implement responsive design:

1. Broaden your audience by supporting multiple device types
2. Ensure consistent gameplay experience across platforms
3. Optimize UI and controls for touch-based interfaces
4. Improve accessibility for players with different device preferences

## Step 1: Detect Mobile Devices

YOM provides a built-in method to identify if a player is connecting from a mobile device:

1. Access the YomGameInstanceSubsystem in your Blueprint or C++ code.
2. Check the "GetIsMobile" boolean.

## Step 2: Adjust for Mobile

Once you've detected a mobile device, you can make appropriate adjustments :

* Increase button sizes for touch input
* Implement different widget blueprints for mobile and desktop
* Utilize Size Boxes and Scale Boxes for flexible layouts
* Use anchors and alignment for position-independent layouts
* Simplify certain menus for smaller screens
* Implement touch-friendly controls

## Step 3: Test with Chrome's Device Mode

To debug and test your mobile layout:

1. Open your game in Chrome
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Click the "Toggle device toolbar" icon or press Ctrl+Shift+M
4. Select different device presets or set custom dimensions
5. Test your game's responsiveness in real-time

## Result:

By implementing these responsive design techniques, your YOM-powered game will provide a smooth, adaptable experience across a wide range of devices, from high-end desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.

*Note: Always test your responsive design on actual devices when possible, as emulators may not perfectly replicate real-world conditions.*

## Registering Events | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/registering-events

The YOM SDK allows you to create and listen for your own custom events, allowing communication between the Unreal client and the pixel streamer /web browser. This guide explains how to set up and use them.

## Step 1: Register a Stream Event

You get register an stream event by getting the YomGameInstanceSubsystem:

1. Set Event Name:

   * Name of the function to call
   * Will be displayed in the "GodMode" modal when enabled
   * Used to call the linked event
2. Set Event:

   * Event to be called when the function named FunctionName is triggered
3. Set NeedsGodMode:

   * Determines if the event is added to GodMode
   * Use for admin-only functions (GodMode requires a password)
4. Create the event:

   * Drag from Event and search for "create event"
   * Select "Create Event" node
   * Choose "select a function" and pick from the dropdown or create a new one
5. Set stream event data

   * When you have variables that need to be passed in your function you can already define what names they have so it will show up in the godmode.
   * You need to create a array and add the amount of variables you have to that.
   * Param Name: name of the param variable.
   * Default Value: the value it needs to have or has at the start.

*Note: The function input will be a Va Rest Json object, allowing data to be sent with the event.*

## Step 2: Handling Event Callback

To process data that is sent with the event:

1. Access the data object passed to the function
2. Use "get field by name and type" to retrieve specific variables
3. Implement your logic using the retrieved data
4. Note that everything we send will be a string and you need to convert that to the type you need.

## Push Events | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/push-events

The YOM SDK allows you to push your own custom events to the browser, allowing communication between the Unreal client and the pixel streamer /web browser. This guide explains how to set up, determine their event scope, and use them.

## Step 1: Use PushYomEvent Function

Once you have the YOMGameInstanceSubsystem, use the PushYomEvent function:

Copy

```
YOMGameInstanceSubsystem->PushYomEvent(PEventScope, PFunction, PVariableNames, PVariableValues);
```

Use the "PushYomEvent" function with these parameters:

* Function: Name of the function to call
* Variable Names: Array of variable names
* Variable Values: Array of variable values
* DataLayer: Boolean to determine whether the event should be [automatically pushed forwards to the DataLayer](/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/event-handling#listen-for-events), used by marketing and data services Google Analytics.

## Result:

By following these steps, you can push communication from your Unreal Engine project to the pixelstreamer/web browser.

## Airdrops | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/airdrops

It is possible to incentivize and reward users in experiences by dropping items directly to their wallet as part of the experience mechanics. This should be done on the server side, and the player must have a connected wallet for it to work. Make sure the inventory is set up as well. In the airdrop node, you need to set two values:

1. YomPlayer: Specify the player to whom the item will be airdropped.
2. Item ID: Provide the ID of the item that will be airdropped. There are separate IDs for devnet and mainnet.

The airdrop node will add an item based on the item ID to the player's wallet. Please note that the airdrop function will not work for users who haven't logged in with a wallet.

## **Checking if airdrop received**

If you want to check if a user has already received an airdrop, you can follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the YomPlayer of the player.
2. Get the inventory of the YomPlayer.
3. Check if there is an item in the inventory with the ID of your master NFT ID. If an item with that ID exists, it means the user has already received the airdrop.

Blueprint to check if airdrop was received

## **Checking wallet connection**

To check if a user has a wallet connected, follow these steps:

1. Get the player you want to check.
2. Retrieve the YomPlayer from that player.
3. Get the wallet of the YomPlayer.
4. Check if the wallet ID is empty. If it's not empty, it means the user has a wallet connected.

Blueprint to check wallet connection

## **Checking if wallet is fetched**

Fetching the wallet may take some time, so there is a callback function called "OnInventoryFetched" that you can use. To check if the wallet has been fetched, do the following:

1. Get the YomPlayer from the player.
2. Check if the YomPlayer has a valid inventory.
3. Bind an event to the "OnInventoryFetched" callback to be notified when the inventory is fetched.

Blueprint to check if wallet is fetched

Note: Airdrops last until the maximum supply of the item has been reached.

## Gated Access | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/gated-access

To create exclusivity and restrict access to experiences based on specific item ownership in YOM, you can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Adding the Gated Access component:

* By default, the Gated Access component (YomGatedAccess) should already be connected to your Metaspace Player. If you don't see it as a component, you'll need to add it manually.
* To add the component, click on the "Add Component" button in the blueprint editor and search for "Yom Gated Access." Add it to your Metaspace Player blueprint.

## Step 2: Adding the Gated Access actor to the level:

* To implement the Gated Access functionality, search for "Yom Gated Access" in the Place Actors window and drag it into the level where you want to create the restricted zone.

## Step 3: Setting the Gated Access Item ID:

* Click on the Gated Access actor in the level.
* Look for the "Item ID" property and insert the NFT address or master ID of the NFT item that is required for access. Note that you have separate IDs for devnet and mainnet.

Setting the Item ID for gated access

## Step 4: Setting up a Collision Layer:

* Set up a collision object channel for the Gated Access to work properly.
* Go to Project Settings and navigate to the Collision section.
* Click on the "New Object Channel" button.
* Name the channel as "GatedAccess" and set the default response to "Overlap."

Example gated access volume, only accessible when possessing a certain Item

Notes:

* You can check if a player has access to the Gated Access zone by calling the blueprint function "Can Player Access."
* Make sure the inventory is enabled for the player for this functionality to work.
* The user's wallet needs to be fetched before they can go through the Gated Access.

## Characters | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/characters

This guide explains how to create and customize a player character for your YOM stream. It covers using YOM's pre-built character or creating your own, understanding existing functionality, and how to modify or extend character features.

## Step 1: Create Your Player Character

1. Create a New Blueprint:

   * Right-click in the Content Browser
   * Select "Blueprint Class"
   * Search for "Yom\_BP\_ThirdPersonCharacter" to use YOM's existing character framework
2. Assign the Player Character:

   * After creating your blueprint, assign it as the player character for your project

## Step 2: Understand Yom\_BP\_ThirdPersonCharacter

Yom\_BP\_ThirdPersonCharacter includes:

1. Movement controls (WASD keys)
2. Interaction system (E key, requires BP\_Interact interface)
3. Camera movement (third-person and first-person)
4. Camera switching (Q key)
5. Crouching (C key)
6. Jumping (Spacebar)
7. Walking/Running toggle (Left Shift)
8. Touch support for mobile devices
9. Customizable settings (walk/run speed, starting view)

## Step 3: Modify Functionality

To customize Yom\_BP\_ThirdPersonCharacter:

1. Override the function you want to change
2. To add functionality:

   * Call the parent function
   * Add your custom logic
3. To remove functionality:

   * Override the function
   * Leave it empty
   * Do not call the parent function

*Note: Overriding* ***preserves*** *changes during SDK updates*

## Step 4: Manage Controls

Default controls use Unreal's Enhanced Input System and are mapped to a controls customization modal that end-users can alter from within the stream:

1. To modify:

   * Create your own "InputMappingContext" in the content folder
   * Add required defaults
   * Create new key mappings for your project

*Caution: Direct changes to default controls may be overwritten by SDK updates*

## Result:

Following these steps allows you to create, customize, and manage your player character while leveraging YOM's existing functionality and maintaining compatibility with future updates.

## Displaying the Control Hints Panel to the player's screen

The YOM SDK allows creators to display a UI widget that would allow the player to understand the basic game controls. This guide will explain how to display and customize your own Control Hints with our ecosystem.

### Step 1: Adding Control Hints component

To use the features of the Control Hints component, it needs to be connected to your player. This should be done by default. However, if you do not see YomControlHints under your player as a component, follow this step. Otherwise, you can skip to step 2.

YomControlHints is a component therefore we need to add it to the player blueprint. To add the component you will have to click add on component menu and search for `Yom Control Hints`.

Pick YomControlHints Component

After this, you need to assign a widget to the YomControlHints component. By default an existing widget should be already available, otherwise you would have to create a one from scratch (step 2).

Pick YomControlHints Widget

## Nameplates | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/nameplates

## Adding a nameplate to your character

The YOM SDK allows creators to design their own nameplates. This guide will explain how to create and use your own nameplates with our ecosystem. If you just want to use our default nameplates, but it has not been enabled yet on your character you can move to Step 2 and use the `YomDefaultNameplateWidget` as your widget.

### Step 1: Creating a custom nameplate

To create a custom nameplate you will have to create a new blueprint asset. Right-click in a folder in the `Content Browser` and under `Create Basic Asset` click on `Blueprint Class`.

Blueprint Class

This will open up the blueprint dialog box in which you can search for `YomNameplateWidget`. Once you find the `YomNameplateWidget` select it.

Pick YomNameplate

You can now customize your nameplate as you like, but one of the widgets must be a `TextBlock` widget with the name `WalletID`. In this `TextBlock` the walletID of the players will be printed when they are loaded into the game. Also give this walletID block a nice default name like `Unknown` for when the nameplate could not be loaded.

### Step 2: Adding the nameplate to your character

Open up your character (this is not your `MetaspacePlayer`, but the character that the players will use to move around with) and under the `Components` tab add a `Widget` component.

Pick Widget Component

Give this widget a nice name like `Nameplate` and select it. Under the `Details -> User Interface -> Widget Class` you can set your widget.

Select Widget Class

Tip: If you want the widget to always face the player, change `Space` from `World` to `Screen`.

In the `Viewport` tab, set the nameplate to the desired position for your character.

### Step 3: Add the YomNameplateManager to your MetaspacePlayer

The nameplates will only work when you tell your `MetaspacePlayer` to load the `YomNameplateManager` in your game on startup. Go to your `MetaspacePlayer` and under `Details -> Yom Player -> Managers` add an element and insert `YomNameplateManager`.

Add YomNameplate Manager

You should now be able to see a nameplate when you spawn into the game.

## Counters | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/counters

## Adding a counter to your metaverse

The YOM SDK allows creators to design their own counters. This guide will explain how to create and use your own counters with our ecosystem.

### Step 1: Adding counter actor the the world

To use the features of the counter, it needs to be added to the world first.

YOM Counter is an actor and needs to be manually added to the world to start working. To add the actor, you will have to slide the actor from `Content Browser` under `Plugins -> YOM Content -> Counter` into your world.

After this, you can call counter functions through blueprints without errors.

### Step 2: Adding counter component to the player

To use the auto replicating feature of the counter (updating a counter value is shared with other clients), you will need to add the counter component to the player blueprint. You can do this by going to your `MetaspacePlayer` and using the add button on the top left corner of the screen.

Pick YomCounter Component

After you do this, you can define what to do when a counter value is updated. This is done by using a callback event. This callback event gives you the name of the counter which is updated and its new value.

Yom Counter Updated

When a counter value is updated with `GetCounterPlayer` blueprint function, this callback function will be called on all of the clients with a counter component. Returned value and the name can be used however you like.

### Step 3: Using blueprint functions to use the component

From the blueprint actions box (it is automatically open or you should right click to the screen), search for `Yom Counter` in order to see the available functions.

Example use case for `Get Counter` function

Get Counter

In this example, we are trying to get `testCounter` in the current metaspace. Counter value is returned by a callback therefore we drag and drop P Callback node and create a custom event. P value returned by the event is the value of the counter which can be used however the user wants. In this example case it is printed to development screen.

Create Callback Event

Example use case for `Add to Counter` function

Add to Counter

In this example, counter is set to increment the `testCounter` in the current metaspace by value 1. Therefore, this will increment that counter value by 1. P Callback function is the function which is returned after API Request is done. It can be used to execute more commands when your increment/decrement request is done.

If callback function is not required, a dummy callback function can be created as it can be seen from the image.

Finally, we can use `Get Counter Player` blueprint function in order to replicate the get request of the counter value. When it is called from a client, it makes a server call which is replicated to other clients as well. This way, all of the connected clients are getting the new value of the counter as well as the name of the counter.

Example use case for `Get Counter Player` function

Get Counter Player

Note: we recommend not updating the counter too much, but 'batch' the counts, as everytime the counter is updated it needs to be updated on the blockchain, which costs money.

## Inventory | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/inventory

## Setting up an inventory

The YOM plugin allows creators to completely design their own inventory system. This guide will explain how to create your own inventory system and how to use your own inventory system in your metaspace.

### Step 1: Creating your own buttons

The inventory system consists of buttons that can be pressed to spawn items. A single button needs to be designed for the system to work. To create a button you will have to create a new blueprint asset. Right-click in a folder in the `Content Browser` and under `Create Basic Asset` click on `Blueprint Class`.

Blueprint Class

This will open up the blueprint dialog box in which you can search for `YomButton`. Once you find the `YomButton` select it.

Pick YomButton

Name the button something like `MyButton` and open up the blueprint by double-clicking the new asset. In the blueprint editor, you will now have an empty screen, in which you will have to design your button. But before you start the button will need some widgets:

* `Canvas` (`Overlay`)

  + The canvas in which the button can be built
* `Button` (`Button`)

  + The button that can be clicked
* `RarityWidget` (Any Widget)

  + The rarity widget, can be seen as the border around the button
* `LoadingWidget` (Any Widget)

  + The widget that is shown when the item is being loaded

All of these widgets also need to have the name of the items described above. In the default `YomButton` the hierarchy looks like this:

YomButton Hierarchy

#### Tips

* Set the visibility of the RarityWidget to `Not Hit-Testable (Self & All Children)` by clicking on the RarityWidget in the hierarchy and going to `Details -> Behavior -> Visibility`. This prevents the Rarity widget from 'overlapping' the button which would prevent a user from pressing the button.
* Design your button with a fixed size this will prevent the buttons from 'stretching' when loaded

### Step 2: Creating your own Inventory Widget

Create another blueprint like in step 1, but this should have `YomPlayerInventoryWidget` selected.

Pick YomPlayerInventory

Give this a name as well like `MyPlayerInventoryWidget` and open up the blueprint by double clicking the new asset. This will again give you an empty screen. On this screen, you can design your layout of the inventory. It will need one widget:

* BaseButtonWidget (A widget with slots for other widgets like the `Scroll Box`)

  + In this widget, your buttons will be created

The hierarchy of the default `InventoryWidget` looks like this:

InventoryWidget Hierarchy

Furthermore, your `MyPlayerInventoryWidget` needs to have some settings applied to it before it works. Click on `MyPlayerInventoryWidget` in the hierarchy and go to `Details -> Yom Inventory`. Here you will see the following settings:

* `Yom Button Widget`

  + The widget for your button, set this to the button you created in step 1.
* `Base Button Widget`

  + This one should be set to the `BaseButtonWidget` in the hierarchy, but if it is not set, you can set it here
* `Start Button Amount`

  + This value tells the inventory system how many buttons it should spawn when the player is connected. If the player has more items than this amount more buttons will be loaded.

#### Tips

* Keep in mind that players could have more items in their inventory than you expect. Your inventory should not deform when a lot of items are being loaded.

### Step 3: Creating a component

Create another blueprint like in step 1, but this should have `YomInventoryComponent` selected.

Pick YomInventoryComponent

Give this a name as well like `MyInventory` and open up the blueprint by double clicking the new asset. In the asset, you will have to set one setting. Go to `Details -> Yom Inventory Component -> Inventory Widget` and set it to the widget you created in Step 2

### Step 4: Setting your inventory in your player

Open your `MetaspacePlayer` and under components remove `YomDefaultInventory` if present. Then add the component that you created in step 3. When you start the game now you can see your own inventory in action when pressing 'I' while playing.

## Portals | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/portals

## Adding a portal to your Stream

The YOM SDK allows creators to design their own portals. This guide will explain how to create and use your own portals with our ecosystem. If you just want to use our default portals, you can use the portals in the `Content Browser` under `Plugins -> YOM Content -> Portals` and skip to step 2. The portals that you can use are the `YomDefaultPortal` and the `YomFXPortal`, where the `YomFXPortal` is more visually appealing. Note that you must have the option `Allow teleporting` set to true, you can verify this by going into your `MetaspacePlayer` and checking if it has a `YomPortallingComponent`.

### Step 1: Creating a Custom portal

To create a custom portal you will have to create a new blueprint asset. Right-click in a folder in the `Content Browser` and under `Create Basic Asset` click on `Blueprint Class`.

Blueprint Class

This will open op the blueprint dialog box in which you can search for `YomPortal`. Once you find the `YomPortal` class select it.

Pick YomPortal

You can now start to customize the portal in every way you like. If you want the plugin to automatically set the material you must set `Details -> Auto Set Portal Material` to true and the portal must have a `StaticMeshComponent` called `PortalDisplay`, this will automatically edit the material of the `StaticMeshComponent` at runtime when you connect to a different stream. If you want to set the material yourself you can use the `Get Portal Material` node in the `Event On Portal Open` and `Event On Portal Close` events. Furthermore the portal will need a `Collision` component for triggering the portal behaviour and you can set a default material under `Details -> Materials` for when the portal is not connected.

### Step 2: Adding the portal to your level

You can now add the newly created portal to your level by taking it from the `Content Browser` and sliding it into your level.

### Step 3: Adding a button to your level

In this step we will describe how to create your own button, if you want to use a default button created by YOM please use the `YomDefaultPortalButton`, which works by pressing `E` in front of the button and go to step 4.

To create your own button we will have to create a blueprint. Right-click in a folder in the `Content Browser` and under `Create Basic Asset` click on `Blueprint Class`.

Blueprint Class

This will open op the blueprint dialog box, in this box click on `Actor`.

Pick Actor

Open up the blueprint and add a collision (we use `Box Collision`).

Pick Box Collision

Click on the new collision component and under `Details -> Events` click on the `+` sign on the `On Component Begin Overlap`.

Pick OnComponentBeginOverlap

This will now open the event graph. Under `Variables` press the `+` sign and add the following two variables:

Setup PortalButtonVariables

Note that you will have to set the types of the variables yourself, and that the 'eye' needs to be open.

After this setup your graph like this:

OpenPortalGraph

You have now created a button that can open a portal when a player runs into the box.

### Step 4: Adding the button to your level

You can now add the newly created button to your level by taking it from the `Content Browser` and sliding it into your level.

### Step 5: Opening the portal

In the `Outliner` find the button that you just put into your level. In the `Details` panel of this actor you can now find the `Portal` and `Url` variables that you created. In the portal set the portal that you added to the level in step 2. The url of the portal should be a valid url to another stream.

### Step 6: Checking the images that are generated

If you start the game now, trigger the button and walk over to your portal you will see the image of your stream in the portal. Furthermore, a directory called `PortalImages` is added to your project root in which the images are stored. These are needed when submitting your project to YOM as these will be used to display your stream in other streams. When your level is hosted the image of another stream will be set in here.

## Overview | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/earn/overview

In the YOM ecosystem, **nodes** are the backbone of a distributed cloud gaming platform. Unlike traditional crypto ‚Äúnodes‚Äù that often sit idle or rely on speculative token emissions, YOM nodes perform **real work** ‚Äì streaming live 3D game sessions to users ‚Äì and **get paid based on actual usage.**

This chapter provides a comprehensive look at how YOM nodes function, how rewards are calculated, and how node operators can maximize their earnings. We‚Äôll also explore practical examples and best practices, presented in a narrative yet professional tone to guide even first-time participants through the technical details.

## What is a Node and How Does It Work?

A YOM node is essentially a slice of a gaming computer or server dedicated to running a cloud gaming session for a player‚Äã. When a player launches a game through YOM‚Äôs platform, the game is actually rendered on a node operator‚Äôs hardware and streamed to the player‚Äôs device in real-time. Each node in the network streams a AAA game to a single concurrent player.

In simpler terms, running a YOM node is akin to hosting a small game server that *one player connects to for a session*, except the player only sees the video feed. Because YOM is decentralized, these nodes aren‚Äôt in a corporate data center ‚Äì they‚Äôre run by everyday operators on their own hardware. Every time content is streamed or rendered by your node, you get paid for that session.

Anyone can run a YOM node, provided they obtain a node license and have access to suitable hardware or cloud infrastructure. A node license is essentially an access token (often an NFT or code) that registers you as an official node operator in the network. Once you have a license, you can choose how to deploy your node: either self-hosted on your own PC/rig or delegated to a verified Node-as-a-Service provider who runs the node on your behalf‚Äã.

## How Many Nodes per Machine?

Notably, one physical machine can run **multiple node instances** (multiple licenses) in parallel if it has enough resources. YOM‚Äôs software modularizes nodes as containers or processes, each serving a different gamer. For example, a powerful GPU like an NVIDIA RTX 4080 can host about **5 concurrent game sessions** by running 5 node licenses simultaneously on the same rig. In fact, each PC can run up to *8 nodes at once* with the plug-and-play YOM setup

This means an operator with a high-end system can multiply their earnings by supporting several players at the same time using a single machine (essentially slicing their GPU/CPU to create multiple nodes). YOM‚Äôs recent node model update was designed to leverage this: by decoupling licenses from hardware, a single expensive GPU can replace what previously required multiple separate rigs. As a result, the network became more scalable and accessible ‚Äì operators with modest setups can start with one or two licenses, while those with beefier hardware can **scale up** by adding more licenses to fully utilize their machine.

## How Node Rewards Work

**YOM‚Äôs reward model is session-based and usage-driven**, aligning incentives with real player activity. This is a key differentiator from many crypto networks that simply act as token farms. Instead, YOM nodes earn in proportion to the gaming sessions they host and continuously attract buying demand.

Every game session your node hosts earns you a fixed reward. Each session typically lasts around 10 minutes and includes a brief advertisement, generating consistent revenue. More sessions translate directly into higher earnings. Let‚Äôs break down how the rewards are calculated:

### Regional Modifiers

Advertising rates vary globally. YOM accounts for regional differences in ad revenue (CPM) and operating costs to ensure fair compensation:

* High-Value Regions: Operators in markets with strong advertising demand (e.g., North America, Western Europe) receive proportionally higher per-session payouts.
* Cost-of-Living Factors: For regions with lower ad rates but also reduced electricity or bandwidth costs, the network adjusts rewards to remain competitive and profitable for local operators.

By tuning rewards daily to reflect changing CPMs or electricity expenses, YOM ensures a stable earning environment for operators worldwide.

### Workload Modifiers

Games that are poorly optimized or highly graphically intensive consume more processing power. Additionally, streaming at **4K, 60 FPS**, or handling popular AAA titles can dramatically increase GPU usage. The simplified reward formula is:

Copy

```
Total YOM/hour = Base Reward √ó Streaming Difficulty Multiplier √ó Regional Modifier
```

Where:

* **Base Reward** corresponds to the session-based ad revenue (aiming for ~$0.30/hour).
* **Difficulty Multiplier** reflects game intensity or stream quality settings.
* **Regional Modifier** adjusts for advertising CPM and local operating costs.

In simpler terms, **your node earns more for harder work**. This dynamic reward component incentivizes operators to accept and successfully run even the most demanding game sessions, since those yield higher returns. It also motivates game developers to optimize their content (because highly unoptimized content costs more to stream), balancing the ecosystem‚Äôs efficiency.

## Earnings Expectations: Practical Examples

One of the most common questions potential node operators ask is ‚Äú**How much can I earn?**‚Äù. YOM provides a realistic forecast by modeling node earnings as a **Gaussian (bell curve) distribution** centered around an expected average.

The assumption is that on **average, a node will be utilized about 50% of the time** it‚Äôs available‚Äã. In other words, roughly half the hours your node is up, it will be actively streaming a session (the other half it might be idle, waiting for demand). Based on network simulations under current conditions, YOM estimates the following monthly earnings per node (for one license running full-time):

* **Average Monthly Earnings:** $77 per node (assuming 50% workload allocation).
* **Lower Bound (-1 SD):** $32 per node, reflecting minimal workload assignments.
* **Upper Bound (+1 SD):** $121 per node, representing optimal demand and performance.

These figures give a **typical range** for a single node license‚Äôs monthly income. The distribution is roughly bell-shaped, meaning most months you can expect to be somewhere around the middle of this range, with occasional dips toward the low end or spikes toward the high end.

It‚Äôs worth noting that **these numbers scale linearly with the number of node licenses you run on your hardware** (assuming your machine can handle it). For example, if you operate a rig with **5 licenses concurrently (e.g. a high-end GPU running five game streams)**, your projected earnings would be about five times the single-node values. Concretely, *five* nodes could yield around **$385 per month on average**, with a lower-bound near $160 and an upper-bound around $605.

YOM also offers a **minimum earnings guarantee** of $10.80/month per node if your node remains consistently available (6 hours daily) but receives no sessions, ensuring a baseline reward.

## **Getting More Work: Maximizing Workload Allocation**

Understanding **how the YOM network distributes workload** is crucial, because it directly affects your earnings. While node rewards are fixed per region, the key to increasing total earnings lies in securing more workload by optimizing several factors that influence allocation. Workload distribution is determined by a combination of **demand-driven factors** and **operator performance metrics.**

* **Reputation:** High uptime, reliability, and active community engagement (accumulating XP through staking and active participation) significantly boost your node‚Äôs priority.
* **Connectivity:** Nodes offering low ping and stable connections are preferred for session assignments. Improve this by hosting your node close to target players and using a reliable wired internet connection.
* **Time-of-Day:** Gaming demand peaks evenings and weekends. Ensuring your node is available during these periods increases your likelihood of receiving session assignments.

Apart from the above factors, YOM‚Äôs orchestrator also performs some balancing to prevent any single node from hogging all jobs or remaining completely idle for too long. If two nodes are equally qualified to take a session (similar latency and reputation), the network might rotate assignments to spread out earnings. Likewise, during periods of **low overall demand**, not every node can be busy 50%+ of the time ‚Äì some will sit idle. In such cases, the system may cycle through available nodes so that each gets at least a few sessions instead of one node taking them all. This balancing act is also constrained by *regional demand*: a surplus of nodes in one region won‚Äôt help another region‚Äôs users. Thus, part of being a node operator is understanding the supply-demand in your chosen region and possibly adapting (which we‚Äôll address in the next section on increasing your workload).

### Practical Steps to Increase Earnings

* **Optimize for Uptime:** Aim for 99%+ uptime. Utilize reliable hardware, power backups, and monitoring tools to maintain consistent availability.
* **Strategic Deployment:** Deploy nodes in high-value or underserved regions to capture higher session volumes and per-session rewards.
* **Scale Smartly:** Add additional node licenses as your hardware comfortably allows, maximizing GPU usage and total earnings.
* **Engage Actively:** Participate in community events and stake earned $YOM tokens to boost your node's reputation, placing you at the front of the line for session allocation.

## Deployment Options: Self-Hosting vs. Node-as-a-Service

4. **Confirm Delegation:**

   * Click the **‚ÄúDelegate‚Äù** button and confirm the transaction in your Web3 wallet.
   * Once confirmed, your node will be handed over to the NaaS provider for management.

### **Step 3: Monitoring Your Delegated Node**

Once your node is successfully delegated, you can monitor its performance through the YOM dashboard. The dashboard provides valuable insights, including:

* **Earnings Overview:**
  Track your daily, weekly, and monthly rewards based on workload allocations.
* **Performance Metrics:**
  See how well your node is performing in terms of uptime and resource allocation.
* **Leaderboard Ranking:**
  Monitor your rank and reputation in the network based on $YRX accumulation and performance.

### **Step 4: Earnings and Payouts**

With delegation, you can expect monthly earnings within an estimated range of:

* **$32 to $121 per month per node,** depending on network activity and workload saturation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Earnings vary based on:**

  + The overall demand for cloud gaming sessions.
  + Regional network saturation and available workload.
  + Your accumulated XP score, which influences workload priority.
* **Payouts are processed automatically** at the end of each earning period and distributed directly to your Web3 wallet.

### **Step 5: Expanding Your Delegation Portfolio**

Once you are comfortable with delegation, you can increase your earning potential by acquiring and delegating additional nodes. This allows you to benefit from multiple revenue streams with minimal effort.

#### **To scale up your earnings:**

1. Purchase additional node licenses from the YOM marketplace.
2. Follow the same delegation process via the dashboard.
3. Monitor multiple nodes and optimize your delegation strategy.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

**1. Can I switch to self-hosting later if I change my mind?**
Yes, you can revoke delegation at any time and transition to self-hosting if you prefer a more hands-on approach.

**2. What happens if my NaaS provider underperforms?**
If your provider fails to meet uptime and performance standards, you can re-delegate your node to another provider via the YOM dashboard.

**3. Are there any fees associated with delegation?**
NaaS providers may charge a small service fee, which is deducted from your monthly earnings. Be sure to check provider details before delegation.

**4. How secure is the delegation process?**
The delegation process is secured through blockchain smart contracts, ensuring transparency and immutability. Your Node NFT remains safely stored in your wallet.

PLEASE READ THE ENTIRETY OF THIS "NOTICE AND DISCLAIMER" SECTION CAREFULLY. NOTHING HEREIN CONSTITUTES LEGAL, FINANCIAL, BUSINESS OR TAX ADVICE AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISOR(S) BEFORE ENGAGING IN ANY ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION HEREWITH. NEITHER YOM B.V. (THE **COMPANY**), ANY OF THE PROJECT TEAM MEMBERS (THE **YOM TEAM**) WHO HAVE WORKED ON YOM (AS DEFINED HEREIN) OR PROJECT TO DEVELOP YOM IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER, ANY DISTRIBUTOR/VENDOR OF $YOM TOKENS (THE **DISTRIBUTOR**), NOR ANY SERVICE PROVIDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY KIND OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS WHATSOEVER WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER IN CONNECTION WITH ACCESSING THE PAPER, DECK OR MATERIAL RELATING TO $YOM (THE **TOKEN DOCUMENTATION**) AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE AT WWW.YOM.NET (THE **WEBSITE**, INCLUDING ANY SUB-DOMAINS THEREON) OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES OR MATERIALS PUBLISHED BY THE COMPANY.

### **1. PROJECT PURPOSE**

You agree that you are acquiring $YOM to participate in YOM and to obtain services on the ecosystem thereon. The Company, the Distributor and their respective affiliates would develop and contribute to the underlying source code for YOM. The Company is acting solely as an arms‚Äô length third party in relation to the $YOM distribution, and not in the capacity as a financial advisor or fiduciary of any person with regard to the distribution of $YOM.

### **2. NATURE OF THE DOCUMENTATION:**

The Token Documentation is a conceptual paper that articulates some of the main design principles and ideas for the creation of a digital token to be known as $YOM. The Token Documentation and the Website are intended for general informational purposes only and do not constitute a prospectus, an offer document, an offer of securities, a solicitation for investment, any offer to sell any product, item, or asset (whether digital or otherwise), or any offer to engage in business with any external individual or entity provided in said documentation. The information herein may not be exhaustive and does not imply any element of, or solicit in any way, a contractual relationship. There is no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of such information and no representation, warranty or undertaking is or purported to be provided as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. Where the Token Documentation or the Website includes information that has been obtained from third party sources, the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates and/or the YOM team have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of such information. Further, you acknowledge that circumstances may change and that the Token Documentation or the Website may become outdated as a result; and neither the Company nor the Distributor is under any obligation to update or correct this document in connection therewith.

### **3. TOKEN DOCUMENTATION**

Nothing in the Token Documentation or the Website constitutes any offer by the Company, the Distributor, or the YOM team to sell any $YOM (as defined herein) nor shall it or any part of it nor the fact of its presentation form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Nothing contained in the Token Documentation or the Website is or may be relied upon as a promise, representation or undertaking as to the future performance of YOM. The agreement between the Distributor (or any third party) and you, in relation to any distribution or transfer of $YOM, is to be governed only by the separate terms and conditions of such agreement.

The information set out in the Token Documentation and the Website is for community discussion only and is not legally binding. No person is bound to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment in relation to the acquisition of $YOM, and no digital asset or other form of payment is to be accepted on the basis of the Token Documentation or the Website. The agreement for distribution of $YOM and/or continued holding of $YOM shall be governed by a separate set of Terms and Conditions or Token Distribution Agreement (as the case may be) setting out the terms of such distribution and/or continued holding of $YOM (the Terms and Conditions), which shall be separately provided to you or made available on the Website. The Terms and Conditions must be read together with the Token Documentation. In the event of any inconsistencies between the Terms and Conditions and the Token Documentation or the Website, the Terms and Conditions shall prevail.

### **4. DEEMED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

By accessing the Token Documentation or the Website (or any part thereof), you shall be deemed to represent and warrant to the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and the YOM team as follows:

(a) in any decision to acquire any $YOM, you have not relied on and shall not rely on any statement set out in the Token Documentation or the Website;

(b) you will and shall at your own expense ensure compliance with all laws, regulatory requirements and restrictions applicable to you (as the case may be);

(c) you acknowledge, understand and agree that $YOM may have no value, there is no guarantee or representation of value or liquidity for $YOM, and $YOM is not an investment product nor is it intended for any speculative investment whatsoever;

(d) none of the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and/or the YOM team members shall be responsible for or liable for the value of $YOM, the transferability and/or liquidity of $YOM and/or the availability of any market for $YOM through third parties or otherwise; and

(e) you acknowledge, understand and agree that you are not eligible to participate in the distribution of $YOM if you are a citizen, national, resident (tax or otherwise), domiciliary and/or green card holder of a geographic area or country (i) where it is likely that the distribution of $YOM would be construed as the sale of a security (howsoever named), financial service or investment product and/or (ii) where participation in token distributions is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act (including without limitation the United States of America, Canada, and the People's Republic of China); and to this effect you agree to provide all such identity verification document when requested in order for the relevant checks to be carried out.

The Company, the Distributor and the YOM team do not and do not purport to make, and hereby disclaims, all representations, warranties or undertaking to any entity or person (including without limitation warranties as to the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of the contents of the Token Documentation or the Website, or any other materials published by the Company or the Distributor). To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including, without limitation, any liability arising from default or negligence on the part of any of them, or any loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data) arising from the use of the Token Documentation or the Website, or any other materials published, or its contents (including without limitation any errors or omissions) or otherwise arising in connection with the same. Prospective acquirors of $YOM should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties (including financial and legal risks and uncertainties) associated with the distribution of $YOM, the Company, the Distributor and the YOM team.

### **5. $YOM TOKEN**

$YOM are designed to be utilised, and that is the goal of the $YOM distribution. In particular, it is highlighted that $YOM:

(a) does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value (nor does any person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value);

(b) is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other digital asset) or any payment obligation by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates;

(c) does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Company, the Distributor (or any of their respective affiliates), or its revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property or licence rights), right to receive accounts, financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to YOM, the Company, the Distributor and/or their service providers;

(d) is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or pretended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;

(e) is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument, unit in a collective investment scheme or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;

(f) is not a loan to the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and

(g) does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates.

Notwithstanding the $YOM distribution, users have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in the assets of the Company, the Distributor, or any of their affiliates after the token distribution.

To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading $YOM does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Company, the Distributor, the distribution of $YOM and YOM. Neither the Company nor the Distributor will create such secondary markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for $YOM.

### **6. INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

The information set out herein is only conceptual, and describes the future development goals for YOM to be developed. In particular, the project roadmap in the Token Documentation is being shared in order to outline some of the plans of the YOM team, and is provided solely for **INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES** and does not constitute any binding commitment. Please do not rely on this information in deciding whether to participate in the token distribution because ultimately, the development, release, and timing of any products, features or functionality remains at the sole discretion of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates, and is subject to change. Further, the Token Documentation or the Website may be amended or replaced from time to time. There are no obligations to update the Token Documentation or the Website, or to provide recipients with access to any information beyond what is provided herein.

YOM may require you to provide additional information and documents at the request of any competent authority or in case of application of any applicable law or regulation, including laws related to anti-laundering (legalization) of incomes obtained by criminal means, or for counteracting financing of terrorism. YOM may also require you to provide additional information and documents in cases where it has reasons to believe that:

a) your Account is being used for money laundering or for any other illegal activity;

b) you have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or

c) transactions made via your Account were made in breach of these Terms.

In such cases, YOM , in its sole discretion, may pause or cancel your purchase transactions until such additional information and documents are reviewed by YOM and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law. If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, YOM may refuse to provide the Service.

By registering an Account on YOM, you give us permission to use your name and picture for marketing and promotional purposes. Users registered as creators also understand and agree that YOM may display, reproduce, and distribute their works represented in digital assets minted, listed and tradable on YOM, for the purpose of operating, promoting, sharing, developing, marketing, and advertising the Website, or any other purpose related to YOM.

### 3. MODIFICATION TO TERMS OF SERVICE

Within the limits of applicable law, YOM reserves the right to review and change this Agreement at any time. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these terms and conditions. Continued use and browsing of the Website after such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

### 4. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

By creating an Account, you consent to receive electronic communications from YOM (e.g. via email or by posting notices to the Service).

These communications may include notices about your Account (e.g. password changes and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with YOM.

You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that YOM sends to you electronically shall satisfy any legal communication requirements, including, but not limited to, that such communications be in writing.

YOM may also send you promotional communications via email, including, but not limited to, newsletters, special offers, surveys and other news and information we think will be of interest to you.

### 5. DISCLAIMERS

Except as expressly provided to the contrary in writing by YOM, the Service and content contained therein, and crypto assets listed therein are provided on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù basis without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied.

YOM makes no warranty that the Service:

a) will meet your requirements;

b) will be available on an uninterrupted and timely basis.

YOM disclaims all other warranties or conditions, express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for particular purpose, title and non-infringement to the Service, as well to the content published therein.

While YOM attempts to make your access to and use of the service and content safe, you accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the internet and will not hold YOM responsible for any breach of security unless it is due to our gross negligence.

YOM shall not be responsible or liable to you for any loss and take no responsibility for, and shall not be liable to you for any use of crypto assets, including but not limited to any losses, damages or claims arising from:

a) user error, such as forgotten passwords, incorrectly contruced transactions, or mistyped addresses;

b) server failure or data loss;

c) corrupted wallet files;

d) unauthorized access to applications;

e) any unauthorized third party activities; including, without limitation, the use of viruses, phishing, brute forcing, or other means of attack against the service or crypto assets.

Crypto assets are intangible digital assets. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in a blockchain. Any transfer of title that might occur in any unique digital asset occurs on the decentralized ledger within the blockchain. YOM does not guarantee that YOM can effect the transfer of title or right in any crypto assets.

However, YOM requests its users who register as creators to warrant that the crypto assets they mint as NFTs and list through YOM are their own individual creations, which have not previously been published and/or exploited in any manner, in order for them to comply with these Terms, under liability to YOM and other users.

YOM is not responsible for sustained casualties due to vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g., wallet, smart contract), blockchains or any other features of crypto assets. YOM is not responsible for casualties due to late report by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the blockchain supporting crypto assets including forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result.

Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability of either party for fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation of laws, or any other activity that cannot be limited or excluded by legitimate means.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties in contracts with consumers, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

### 6. ASSUMPTION OF RISKS

You accept and acknowledge:

a) The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the crypto assets, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of crypto assets will not lose money.

b) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your crypto assets transactions. YOM is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to crypto assets transactions.

c) There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that YOM shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the crypto assets, however caused.

d) A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of crypto assets.

e) The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of crypto assets.

f) There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. YOM reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on YOM. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on YOM serve as grounds for a claim against YOM.

### 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall YOM be liable to you or any third party for any lost profit or any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising from these terms, the Service, or for any damages related to loss of revenue, loss of profit, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, or loss of data, and whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or otherwise.

The access to and use of the Services are at your own discretion and risk, and you shall be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data resulting therefrom.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the maximum aggregate liability of YOM arising out of or in any way related to these terms, the access to and use of the service, content, crypto assets, or any products or services purchased on the service exceed the greater of:

a) the amount received by YOM from the sale of crypto assets that are the subject of the claim, and

b) the operational costs from the sale of crypto assets that are the subject of the claim.

The foregoing limitations of liability shall not apply to liability of YOM for:

a) death or personal injury caused by a member of YOM's negligence; or for

b) any injury caused by a member of YOM's fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.

### 8. TERMINATION

Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Service at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

### 9. SEVERABILITY

If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision shall be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

### 10. APPLICABLE LAW

This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the Netherlands. Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the competent courts of the Netherlands, the jurisdiction of the Dutch Court being expressly reserved.

## **Token Allocation:**

* **Ecosystem (17.5%, 36 months linear lockup).** This pool is reserved for node operators to support their idle node time via a flat payout rate. This pool gets replenished with 10% of continuous node rewards. All transactions from this pool are programmatic and on-chain and serve as a buffer for getting to global coverage.
* **Treasury (30%, 36 months linear lockup).** The treasury involves all other non-programmatic transactions that have the mission to stimulate adoption towards decentralized cloud compute. This involves payments to get onto exchanges, provide grants to onboard game studios and pay for expenses that bolster YOM‚Äôs non-profit mission.
* **OPEX (7,5%, 36 months linear lockup).** Involves a total grant pool allocated to the team, advisors and OPEX expenses.
* **Community / Burned (30%)**: This pool is the transfer for our OG holder community who decided to never sell (12 months vesting) and bridge. The tokens that didn't vest/bridge, got burned
* **Public Round (3%).** We aim to reserve a small fraction of our supply to cover the marketing costs we spent around the TGE and node rollout.
* **Liquidity pool (7%).** The token remainder is reserved for and added to liquidity pools to facilitate trading on DEXs and exchanges.

## FAQ | YOM Docs

**Source:** https://docs.yom.net/about/faq

### **1. General Questions**

#### **What is YOM?**

YOM is a **decentralized cloud gaming infrastructure (DePIN)** that allows users to stream immersive gaming experiences to any device without the need for expensive hardware. YOM connects idle GPU resources from self-hosted and delegated nodes to studios, brands, and broadcasters, offering scalable, cost-efficient cloud gaming solutions.

#### **How does YOM work?**

YOM utilizes a decentralized network of gaming machines (nodes) running our custom **Node OS**, which stream gaming sessions to end users. Studios and brands pay for these services, and node operators earn rewards in $YOM tokens for providing computing resources.

#### **Who can benefit from YOM?**

* **Node Operators:** Earn passive income by contributing GPU resources to the network.
* **Community Members:** Participate in governance, earn XP rewards, and engage with the ecosystem.
* **Studios & Brands:** Leverage YOM to provide immersive, high-quality experiences to their audiences at a fraction of traditional cloud gaming costs.

---

### **2. Node Operators**

#### **How can I start running a YOM node?**

You can start by choosing one of two options:

1. **Delegation (Hands-off approach):**

   * Purchase a node license for $199 and delegate it to a Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) provider.
2. **Self-Hosting (Hands-on approach):**

   * Purchase a **plug-and-play device** or set up the node via a **manual code installation** on your gaming rig.

#### **What are the hardware requirements for self-hosting?**

* **GPU:** Any NVIDIA RTX config (2060RTX and higher) with high VRAM to maximize node capacity.
* **CPU:** Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9 for better multitasking and stability.
* **RAM:** 16GB would be sufficient on low config setups, but 32GB+ is recommended.
* **Storage:** No storage needed for plug n play solution. For custom Linux boot deployment: 1TB+ available space needed.
* **Internet:** Wired Ethernet connection (min 25mbps upload).

#### **How much can I earn by running a node?**

Earnings depend on workload demand and regional factors. On average:

* **Lower Bound (-1 SD):** $32 per node/month
* **Average:** $77 per node/month
* **Upper Bound (+1 SD):** $121 per node/month

*Earnings assume 50% workload utilization across different demand periods.*

#### **What is the difference between delegation and self-hosting?**

* **Delegation:** Fully managed by a NaaS provider, with minimal effort required. Lower technical involvement but lower optimization potential.
* **Self-Hosting:** Provides full control over operations and the potential for higher earnings with greater responsibility for setup and maintenance.

#### **What costs should I consider when self-hosting?**

Costs include:

* **Hardware acquisition:** New rigs vs. using existing setups.
* **Electricity costs:** Managing power efficiency for profitability.
* **Scaling costs:** Adding more node licenses to increase earnings.

---

### **3. Studios & Brands**

#### **Why should I use YOM for cloud gaming?**

YOM offers:

* **Cost Efficiency:** Reduce cloud gaming costs from $6/hour to $0.30/hour.
* **Scalability:** Access a global network of nodes without infrastructure investment.
* **Ease of Integration:** Embed streams directly into websites, apps, and platforms with a single line of code.
* **Customization:** Implement branding, analytics, and monetization strategies easily.

#### **How is game performance ensured across different devices?**

YOM uses an **AI-powered Resource Orchestrator** that dynamically selects the best nodes based on:

* **Latency:** Ensuring the lowest possible ping.
* **Node Reputation:** Prioritizing high-performing nodes with good uptime.
* **Game Availability:** Allocating nodes with pre-loaded game assets for faster deployment.

#### **What pricing model does YOM use?**

YOM follows a **session-based pricing model**, where studios pay:

* **$0.05 per gaming session** (based on an average 10-minute session).
* **$89/month base fee** for access to analytics and dashboard services.

#### **How does advertising impact earnings and costs?**

The YOM ecosystem integrates advertising seamlessly into gaming sessions. Studios benefit by:

* Leveraging **pre-session ads** that align with their goals.
* Receiving a revenue share from ad impressions during gameplay.
* Reducing costs via ad-supported models while maintaining player engagement.

---

### **4. Tokenomics & Rewards**

#### **What is $YOM and how does it work?**

$YOM is the native utility token of the YOM ecosystem, used for:

* Paying for cloud gaming services.
* Rewarding node operators for their contribution.
* Staking to earn additional rewards.
* Ensuring network security and sustainability through a **deflationary model** (5% burn on usage).

#### **What is XP and its role in the ecosystem?**

XP is a **soul-bound value** that represents user contributions and engagement in the ecosystem. It is used to:

* Boost leaderboard rankings for better workload allocation.
* Participate in governance decisions via the YOM DAO.
* Gain eligibility for additional $YOM drops and rewards.

#### **Is $YOM inflationary or deflationary?**

YOM follows a **deflationary model**, meaning no new tokens are minted, and a portion of each transaction is burned, reducing supply over time. This ensures value retention for stakeholders.

#### **How can I earn more rewards?**

Increase earnings by:

* Maintaining high uptime and reliability for better workload allocation.
* Participating in the **Streak Program**, which provides bonus rewards for consistent online presence.
* Accumulating XP to boost node rankings and priority.

### **5. Governance & Community**

#### **How does governance work in the YOM ecosystem?**

YOM operates under a **DAO model**, allowing the community to influence key decisions, such as:

* Platform policies and content guidelines.
* Allocation of treasury funds to support network growth.
* Voting on feature updates and ecosystem improvements.

#### **What are the roles within the DAO?**

* **Moderators:** Manage community engagement and uphold policies.
* **Commissioners:** Oversee quality assurance and approve projects.
* **Cardinals:** Propose policies and contribute to strategic planning.

#### **How can I participate in the YOM community?**
