<h2>Introduction | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net</p>
<p>Gaming has transformed dramatically over the last decades, driven by
technological advancements that redefine player interactions and
immersive experiences. Today, three main methods dominate gaming
consumption:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Gaming:</strong> Easy development and widespread
access, but limited by hardware constraints and app download
friction.</li>
<li><strong>Console / PC Gaming:</strong> Premium graphics and high
performance, but requires costly hardware, significant downloads, and
lengthy installations.</li>
<li><strong>WebGL Gaming:</strong> Instant access via browsers without
installations, yet struggles with optimization and performance across
various devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these models comes with trade-offs that force developers to
balance accessibility, quality, and cost efficiency.</p>
<h3><strong>Pixel Streaming‚ÄîThe Game Changer</strong></h3>
<p>Pixel streaming‚Äîcommonly known as cloud gaming‚Äîeliminates hardware
barriers completely, enabling AAA games to run instantly and seamlessly
on smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and browsers.</p>
<p>Our vision: pixel streaming will soon become the <strong>standard
across all gaming platforms</strong>, due to its unique
capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-Device Compatibility:</strong> High-quality gameplay
instantly delivered to any device, without installation or compatibility
concerns, significantly increasing accessibility and developer
reach.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Channel Integration:</strong> Games easily embedded
into social media (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook), e-commerce sites
(Amazon), and apps, multiplying touchpoints for user engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Delivery:</strong> Console-level performance
independent of local hardware limitations, ensuring smooth user
experiences with seamless transitions across devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>This revolutionary approach allows websites, apps, and platforms to
independently serve sophisticated, interactive content, reshaping
digital strategies for content creators, brands, and game studios
alike.</p>
<p>Beyond gaming, pixel streaming is poised to accelerate the Open
Metaverse, enabling instant global delivery of immersive content without
dependency on specialized client hardware‚Äîbringing digital twins,
virtual real estate tours, personalized AI interactions, and interactive
episodic experiences to life instantly.</p>
<h3><strong>The Centralization Problem</strong></h3>
<p>Yet, despite its promise, pixel streaming faces a major bottleneck:
centralized infrastructure. Current cloud GPU solutions rely heavily on
costly, inefficient, and environmentally unsustainable data centers.
Massive investments in cooling, maintenance, and continuous hardware
upgrades drive soaring operational costs and significant carbon
emissions. A handful of technology giants hold near-total control,
limiting accessibility and stifling innovation.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, GPU computational power underpins critical
advancements‚Äîfrom AI and robotics to cloud gaming and the emerging
Metaverse. Demand is exploding, but traditional centralized models
simply cannot scale efficiently or sustainably.</p>
<p>Notably, <strong>50‚Äì75% of global GPU capacity currently remains idle
in consumer devices</strong>‚Äîan untapped resource representing a vast
pool of computational power. Leveraging this idle capacity could
effectively double available GPU resources worldwide, providing a highly
scalable and cost-effective solution.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Decentralization Is the Future</strong></h3>
<p>Cloud gaming is the perfect candidate for blockchain-enabled
decentralization. Unlike AI training or batch processing (which tolerate
centralized infrastructure constraints), cloud gaming requires:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultra-low latency</strong></li>
<li><strong>High availability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flexible scalability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional cloud providers struggle with these critical
requirements.</p>
<p>YOM‚Äôs peer-to-peer cloud gaming network flips the script, utilizing
the untapped GPU power of household gaming rigs and consumer-grade PCs.
It offers a purely serverless pixel-streaming model‚Äîeliminating the need
for centralized data centers altogether.</p>
<p>This innovative decentralized approach offers clear advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drastic Cost Reduction:</strong> Eliminating capital
expenditures (CAPEX) entirely and significantly reducing operational
expenditures (OPEX), bringing costs from typical $1‚Äì2/hour down to
~$0.10/hour.</li>
<li><strong>Global Reach, Local Performance:</strong> Decentralized
architectures naturally expand globally while providing localized
connectivity‚Äîdelivering ultra-low latency (sub-30 ms) and exceptional
user experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Economic &amp; Environmental Liberation:</strong>
Transferring power from large centralized cloud providers back to gamers
and hardware owners, while significantly reducing environmental impact
by recycling existing GPU resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Infrastructure | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/infrastructure</p>
<p>YOM‚Äôs architecture is purpose-built for decentralized,
high-performance cloud gaming. It combines a custom pixel streaming
solution, secure edge computing, and intelligent decentralized
orchestration to deliver interactive streaming with near-local
responsiveness and reliability.</p>
<p>The platform spans from a proprietary pixel streaming services and
developer SDKs to the underlying network of trusted GPU nodes
coordinated by an AI-driven scheduler. Together, these components enable
any AAA game to be streamed instantly to any device with sub-40‚ÄØms
latency, high reliability (through rapid failover), and end-to-end
security ‚Äì all at a fraction of the cost of traditional cloud
gaming.</p>
<h3><strong>1.</strong> Peer-to-Peer Pixel Streaming</h3>
<p>YOM has developed its own lightweight pixel-streaming service that
runs games on remote consumer-grade GPUs and streams the video feed back
to players via WebRTC for minimal latency.</p>
<p>Once a session is approved, the gameplay is delivered over a direct
peer-to-peer connection between the node and the player‚Äôs device.</p>
<p>YOM‚Äôs streaming protocol establishes an encrypted video/audio stream
and input channel without routing through any central server, minimizing
latency by eliminating extra hops. Game audio/video and player input
data are end-to-end encrypted, so the content remains private and secure
even if it traverses relays or public networks.</p>
<h3><strong>2. AI-Powered Orchestration</strong></h3>
<p>Workload allocation across the YOM network is handled by HyperOrch,
YOM‚Äôs decentralized orchestration engine.</p>
<p>HyperOrch continuously gathers telemetry from each node ‚Äì a
multi-dimensional ‚Äúcapability vector‚Äù including available GPU/CPU
capacity, memory, bandwidth, encoder load, thermal headroom, and more.
Similarly, each game title is characterized by a resource footprint
profile (GPU demand, memory needs, expected bitrate, etc.).</p>
<p>Using these inputs, HyperOrch‚Äôs AI-driven scheduler predicts the
expected performance (e.g. framerate) for a given game on each candidate
node and dynamically matches players to the optimal node in real time.
Unlike naive approaches that just pick the nearest server, HyperOrch
filters and ranks nodes by multiple criteria (player-to-node latency,
hardware suitability for the game, current load, etc.) to find a host
that can deliver smooth 60+ FPS and &lt;40‚ÄØms ping for that session.</p>
<p>The orchestrator even learns from each session: it updates its model
with actual performance outcomes, continuously improving placement
decisions over time. This intelligent scheduling maximizes network-wide
performance and efficiency ‚Äì avoiding bad host-game pairings that might
lag, fully utilizing available GPU headroom, and reducing costs by
optimally balancing the load on community nodes.</p>
<p>In practical terms, HyperOrch‚Äôs real-time decision-making ensures
each player is connected to a node that will give them a console-quality
experience, and it can proactively migrate or redistribute sessions if a
better match becomes available.</p>
<h3>2. Developer SDKs</h3>
<p>The YOM Player Integration Library lets you embed live YOM game
streams in any web property via <strong>two approaches</strong>:</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Use Case</p>
<p>Key Benefit</p>
<p><strong>Basic Embed</strong></p>
<p>One-off landing pages, quick demos</p>
<p>Copy-and-paste <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></p>
<p><strong>Custom UI Embed</strong></p>
<p>Full-fledged portals, dynamic controls</p>
<p>Script-based API + UI state manager</p>
<p>Both methods handle secure messaging between your page and the YOM
Player, manage UI transitions, and expose an event/command API.</p>
<p>YOM provides optional Unreal Engine and Unity SDKs that integrate the
streaming service seamlessly into their games. These SDKs let developers
incorporate responsive HUD overlays, site widgets that can communicate
directly with the stream, and custom authentication or monetization
flows to tailor the player experience.</p>
<h3>3. Node OS</h3>
<p>The nodes boot a minimal, read‚Äëonly Linux image. On first launch the
operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Auto‚Äëdetects hardware &amp; installs signed GPU
drivers</strong> so the discrete card is exposed at full performance (no
user intervention required).</li>
<li>Runs a <strong>registration module</strong> that authenticates the
user, measures uplink bandwidth, RTT to regional probes, idle GPU
capacity, and temperature; it then publishes this capability vector to
the discovery ledger for HyperOrch scheduling.</li>
<li>Provides an isolated execution sandbox that mounts each game image
read‚Äëonly, passes the GPU through exclusively.</li>
</ul>
<p>During gameplay the OS reports live telemetry (FPS, 95‚Äëth percentile
latency, thermals); if thresholds are exceeded it can dynamically
down‚Äëclock the game container or request HyperOrch migration. On
shutdown‚Äîor if the boot drive is removed‚Äîthe OS triggers a
<strong>rollback routine</strong> that asserts a PCIe reset, DMA‚Äëscrubs
RAM and VRAM, clears any drive keys, and reboots, ensuring no player
data or studio IP persists. Updates follow an atomic A/B scheme: a new
signed image is written to the inactive slot and only activated after
signature verification and checksum pass, with automatic rollback on
failure.</p>
<h3>4.‚ÄØ<strong>Decentralized Discovery &amp; Attestation</strong></h3>
<p>Nodes publish signed availability records (location hash, GPU class,
live load) to a <em>distributed hash table / on‚Äëchain registry</em>.
Clients query the same ledger, pick candidates within a latency radius,
then request the node‚Äôs latest attestation. If the proof checks out the
client proceeds; if not, the node is black‚Äëlisted until it
re‚Äëestablishes trust. This <strong>serverless matchmaking</strong>
eliminates single points of failure and allows the network to scale
organically while remaining secure.</p>
<h3>5.‚ÄØ<strong>Node &amp; Stream Management Portal</strong></h3>
<p>Operators and studios manage everything through a secure web
dashboard. <strong>Node owners</strong> view uptime, earned‚ÄØrewards,
temperature metrics, and update status; they can schedule maintenance
windows or toggle delegated hosting. <strong>Publishers</strong> upload
and manage builds, set session budgets, and track live QoE metrics
(latency heat‚Äëmaps, FPS histograms).</p>

<h2>Node Reputation | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/node-reputation</p>
<p>XP serves as a soul-bound metric in the YOM ecosystem, meaning it is
permanently tied to each user‚Äôs unique identity and cannot be traded or
transferred. XP rankings appear on both short-term (weekly or monthly)
and all-time leaderboards. This dual display encourages fresh
participants to climb the ranks while acknowledging veteran members for
their longstanding dedication. Here are some of the benefit of high
XP:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Node Rewards</strong> The more XP a node
operator has, the higher their position on the operator leaderboard.
This can translate into increased session allocations or bonus
multipliers for node earnings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Airdrops &amp; Exclusive Perks</strong> High-ranking XP
holders periodically receive <strong>$YOM drops</strong> or discounted
access to partner programs. They may also enjoy early access to premium
features, events, or beta releases within the YOM ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Governance Influence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voting Power:</strong> While holding $YOM typically grants
voting rights, XP acts as a <strong>multiplier</strong>‚Äîthe most engaged
and knowledgeable community members gain proportionally greater voting
weight.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal Privileges:</strong> Certain high-XP brackets may
unlock the ability to propose major changes or direct resource
allocation in the DAO, guiding crucial development decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Recognition</strong> Exclusive badges and
titles‚Äîdisplayed within the YOM dApp, community forums, and in-game
environments‚Äîhelp top XP earners stand out. These digital ‚Äústatus
symbols‚Äù showcase trustworthiness and expertise to other users.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>How to earn XP?</h3>
<p>The YOM dApp and <a href="https://discord.gg/MwdDRdmZ">Discord</a>
facilitate easy access for members to participate in activities where
they can earn XP, enhancing their engagement and influence within the
YOM community. Core earning avenues are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Holding $YOM</strong> Simply by holding $YOM, your
wallets accrues XP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Node Operation &amp; Reliability</strong> Node owners who
run stable, high-uptime machines accumulate XP in proportion to the
reliability and performance of their nodes. This ensures that those
contributing critical infrastructure earn corresponding reputation
points.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Engagement &amp; Content Creation</strong>
Active Discord or forum participation, creation of high-quality guides
or tutorials, and social media advocacy all generate XP. This mechanism
rewards both the technical and cultural contributors who help grow and
educate the community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DAO Participation &amp; Governance</strong></p>
<p>Authors of successful proposals‚Äîthose that pass and benefit the
platform‚Äîgain additional XP whilst regular, informed voting on proposals
further builds a user‚Äôs reputation in the community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mod/Peer Voting &amp; Seasonal Challenges:</strong>
Periodic events hosted by the YOM Foundation or community-driven
committees can offer bonus XP for tasks like stress-testing new features
or helping onboard new members. Certain XP awards are distributed
through peer recognition, where outstanding contributions or helpful
community moderation receive upvotes or endorsements from other
members.</p></li>

<h2>Tokenomics | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/tokenomics</p>
<p>The $YOM token is the economic linchpin of the network, with its
deflationary model and reward dynamics carefully designed to balance
short-term incentives (node rewards, studio growth) with long-term
scarcity (5% burn on each transaction).</p>
<h2>Medium of Exchange</h2>
<p>$YOM serves as the primary currency for accessing and operating cloud
gaming sessions. Studios, brands, and broadcasters purchase $YOM to
power these streams, creating a continuous demand tied directly to
network usage.</p>
<p>Node operators who contribute GPU resources are paid in $YOM,
ensuring that high-performance nodes with greater uptime and reliability
capture higher earnings. This token-based reward model fuels a
self-sustaining cycle: more users and games ‚Üí more sessions ‚Üí more
demand for $YOM.</p>
<h4><strong>It's Network Fuel</strong></h4>
<p>The token has a strict deflationary structure: no new tokens can ever
be minted. Instead, Whenever someone plays a game on the network, a
percentage (5%) of the network rewards are burned. Since every purchase
of $YOM directly eliminates a portion of tokens from the market, the
float becomes scarcer over time. This design boost long-term token value
whilst aligning token holders with network usage.</p>
<h4><strong>Liquidity Provision</strong></h4>
<p>While node operation is a key earning avenue, community members can
also use $YOM to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. These
activities not only secure the network and facilitate smooth token
trading, but also offer participants a passive way to accrue additional
rewards.</p>
<h2>Flow of Value</h2>
<p>Publishers utilize $YOM tokens to pay node operators for running the
sessions. The payment usually starts as a recurring FIAT payment, which
gets automatically swapped into $YOM. Below is the distribution key:</p>
<p>Stakeholder</p>
<p>Distribution %</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p><strong>Nodes</strong></p>
<p>40</p>
<p>The majority of the rewards go directly to node operators to
incentivize their participation and ensure high uptime and
performance.</p>
<p><strong>Network</strong></p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Funds allocated to infrastructure improvements, software updates and
scaling operations.</p>
<p><strong>Burned</strong></p>
<p>5</p>
<p>This mechanism keeps the token supply deflationary, aligning all
stakeholders.</p>
<p>As node operators receive $YOM, some choose to hold to accumulate
more XP, become active in the DAO, or provide liquidity on decentralized
exchanges, further fueling the network‚Äôs growth and liquidity. Others
may convert tokens to cover operational costs.</p>

<h2>DAO | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/manifesto/dao</p>
<p>A key pillar of our mission towards decentralization is the
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which coordinates
decision-making processes on-chain and in democratic fashion.</p>
<p>The DAO is tasked with overseeing the network‚Äôs foundational
governance and long-term vision. Representing the DAO is the YOM
Foundation is a non-profit entity.</p>
<h2>Decision-Making</h2>
<p>The primary layer of governance influence is embedded within XP
(Experience Points). The higher a participant‚Äôs XP, the more weight
their votes carry, ensuring that engaged contributors who have
demonstrated consistent, positive impact in the ecosystem shape its
evolution.</p>
<p>All major decisions, including votes, funding distributions, and
policy changes, are recorded on-chain. This transparent ledger
reinforces accountability and ensures that any community member can
audit the decision-making process at any time. The DAO manages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Anything that impacts the network at
large, such as security standards, advertising guidelines, and core
protocol updates.</li>
<li><strong>Tokenomics:</strong> Any change to burn rates, reward
structures, or additional deflationary mechanisms must be vetted and
approved by the DAO.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Key updates to the underlying
protocol, such as improved node benchmarking or new streaming standards,
are decided collectively.</li>
<li><strong>Budgeting:</strong> A dedicated treasury, supports grants,
development incentives, ecosystem programs (BUILD/EARN), and other
community-led initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Moderation:</strong> DAO-elected moderators ensure content
alignment with broader ecosystem goals and uphold community
standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, more aspects of YOM‚Äôs operations will migrate on-chain,
from resource allocation in ecosystem programs to deeper integration of
node management. This shift aims to minimize central points of failure
and consolidate community ownership. Initiatives will increasingly rely
on DAO proposals and votes to select and fund recipients. This
progressive handover of program administration‚Äîfrom Foundation-led to
entirely community-driven‚Äîfurther empowers the network‚Äôs most active
members.</p>
<p>As the platform matures, a series of transparent milestones will
detail how specific powers, assets, and policy controls are transferred
from the Foundation to the DAO. The ultimate goal is to establish a
completely trustless, self-governing environment in which all critical
decisions emerge from community consensus and aligned economic
incentives.</p>
<p>YOM‚Äôs governance model harnesses the collective wisdom of its
community, elevates committed contributors through XP-based weighting,
and grants creators and users the autonomy to shape their own
experiences. With a measured transition toward full decentralization,
YOM ensures that no single entity holds disproportionate power,
sustaining a balanced, community-led ecosystem for the long term.</p>
<h2>DAO Limitations</h2>
<p>Within the framework of DAO-approved standards, studios and content
creators maintain full autonomy. Only content that contravenes essential
DAO policies, such as those related to user safety, or malicious
behavior faces moderation or revocation of streaming privileges.</p>

<h2>Overview | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/build/overview</p>
<p>This guide introduces best practices for integrating the YOM SDK with
your game, enabling seamless connection between your stream and web
technologies.</p>
<p>Developing for YOM differs from traditional projects. Each stream
exists on a webpage, instantly accessible from any device. This approach
necessitates avoiding loading screens and complex UI in favor of
instant, holistic, integral game design. This new methodology requires
considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing with "responsiveness" and "instant gameplay" in mind</li>
<li>Debugging with web servers rather than just in UE5 viewports</li>
<li>Bi-directional game-to-web communication</li>
<li>Web Widgets and Analytics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Build on YOM?</h2>
<h4>Rapid Game Deployment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Both multiplayer and singleplayer.</li>
<li>Focus on core AAA+ experiences, not menus</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cross-Platform Reach</h4>
<ul>
<li>Target large audiences via device-independent compatibility</li>
<li>Easy embedding in websites and platforms</li>
<li>Affordable &amp; scalable DePIN hosting</li>
</ul>
<h4>Integrate Everything</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seamlessly integrate external data sources &amp; events</li>
<li>Native tag manager integration for analytics</li>
</ul>
<h4>Customization / White-label</h4>
<ul>
<li>White-label user journeys from login to stream</li>
<li>Integrate custom web widget support for enhanced interactivity</li>
<li>Manage admin accounts to trigger in-game events</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>The integration SDK includesa simple Node.js web server referencing a
sample HTML + JS implementation. When launching a stream via the YOM
Toolbar in UE5, you can optionally start your preferred web server,
allowing local debugging of the entire user journey.</p>
<p>We provide a JS library that enables integration and full
customization of the stream experience, from authentication to
deployment and execution. We provide functionalities like callbacks and
multi-stream capabilities for effective control over stream and
authentication processes.</p>
<p>Figure 1: illustrates our reference HTML implementation demonstrating
authentication (included with SDK)</p>
<h2>Stream Embed</h2>
<p>Post-authentication, the embedded stream loads as an iFrame, spawning
the player and <a
href="/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/dynamic-layouts">hiding
certain components</a>. The stream automatically scales across aspect
ratios while maintaining resolution quality. Test this in the reference
implementation by resizing horizontally (desktop) or vertically
(mobile).</p>
<p>Figure 2: showcases a sample web widget and the stream with an
expanded modal.</p>
<p>To accommodate limited user attention, especially for web-based
streams, we utilize a simple, customizable modal that loads
post-launching/spawning and its visibility can be managed via the SDK.
This allows focus on game development while minimizing overhead and time
spent on UI.</p>
<p>The modal includes a "God-mode" option, accessible via a password in
the login field. This feature enables real-time in-game event execution
without building web components, facilitating testing and script
execution. God-mode benefits both developers and moderators, enabling
efficient game management and testing.</p>
<p>Figure 3: demonstrates the "God-mode" interface, displaying custom
functions registered via the SDK.</p>

<h2>Getting Started | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started</p>
<p>The GETTING STARTED section provides a comprehensive guide on how to
properly set up and deliver your project to ensure compatibility with
the YOM build pipeline.</p>
<p>To create your first experience, you need to broadly follow these
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new or open an existing project.</li>
<li>Import the <a
href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mv0RNi9jmkz9L3PJWQnSu5ey-2IJek1B?usp=drive_link">UE5
SDK</a> in your project.</li>
<li>Test and debug your experience locally until it runs perfectly.</li>
<li>Build and then publish your experience via the <a
href="https://app.yom.ooo/">app</a>.</li>
<li>Integrate your experience on your website with a single line of
code.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Checklist Before Starting (!):</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are opting to use YOM within an existing Unreal Engine
project, please check the <strong>Linux support for existing
plugins</strong>. If your plugin does not officially support compile to
Linux, in most cases it still compiles to Linux and if not on the first
try, the fix is usually very simple.</li>
<li>For multiplayer support you need to download and use the <a
href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/BuildingUnrealEngine/">source
version</a> of Unreal Engine.</li>
<li>You need to install <a

<h2>Compile your Game | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/compile-your-game</p>
<h2>Step 1: Prepare your project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your project is in C++ and uses the correct Unreal Engine
source version.</li>
<li>Verify you have the right <a
href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3#nativetoolchain">Clang</a>
version for cross-platform compiling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Package the project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the top bar: Platforms ‚Üí Linux.</li>
<li>Set the Build Target to Game or Server</li>
<li>Click "Package Project" at the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting a folder to build your project we recommend creating a
new folder in your project folder called "Build". Choose this "Build"
folder as the destination for both client and server builds.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Generate builds</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wait for the build process to complete. Speed may vary depending on
the size of your project.</li>
<li>Verify that two folders, "Linux" and "Linux Server", are created
inside the "Build" folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 5: Package for YOM</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Unreal Engine, go to the top bar: Tools ‚Üí YOM ‚Üí Package
Project.</li>
<li>In the opened menu, select the paths to your client and server build
folders.</li>
<li>If you used the recommended "Build" folder, paths should be
automatically selected.</li>
<li>Click "Package Project" to create separate zip files for the client
and server.</li>
<li>After the process completes, find a new folder called "BuildData" in
your project directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>Inside "BuildData", you'll find two zip files, one for the client and
one for the server, that are ready to upload to <a
href="https://app.yom.ooo">app.yom.ooo</a>.</p>

https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream</p>
<p>Great that you have come this far.</p>
<p>Congratulations on deploying your stream. Now, it's time to share it
with your fans.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to integrate your metaverse into your
website.</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add the YOM Core script to your HTML: Insert this line inside the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of your HTML file:</li>
</ul>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https://temp-yom-branding.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/yom-core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a target div for your stream: Place this div within the
desired location in your webpage and replace <code>data-streamurl</code>
with your personalized stream url:</li>
</ul>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>&lt;div id="yomTarget-1" data-streamurl="${STREAM_URL}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Add User Input and Launch Button somewhere on your page:</li>
</ul>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>&lt;input type="text" id="yomInput-1" placeholder="Your Name"&gt; &lt;button id="yomLaunch-1"&gt;Start Experience&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
<p>That's it! You now have a basic YOM integration. Launch your page to
see it in action.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you encounter issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check your browser console for error messages.</li>
<li>Ensure all required scripts are loaded correctly.</li>
<li>Verify that stream URLs are correct and accessible.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Custom Authentication | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/custom-authentication</p>
<p>You can define your own custom functions to validate user input on
button click. To achieve this add
<code>data-callback="{someFunction}"</code> to the launch button. Then
define your custom function in a JS file that accepts two parameters:
<code>onSuccess, onFailure</code>.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>We have as an example the following HTML elements:</p>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>&lt;input type="text" id="yomInput" placeholder="your name" autofocus&gt; &lt;input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter password"&gt; &lt;button type="submit" data-callback="validatePassword" id="yomLaunch-1"&gt;start the experience&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
<p>In the following example function we perform simple front-end
validation to match the
data-<code>callback="validatePassword"</code>attribute defined in the
<code>yomLaunch-1</code> button:</p>
<p>Copy</p>
<p>``` function validatePassword(onSuccess, onFailure) { const
passwordInput = document.getElementById('password'); const
enteredPassword = passwordInput.value; const hardcodedPassword =
'secure123'; // This is the hardcoded password</p>
<pre><code>if (enteredPassword === hardcodedPassword) {
    onSuccess();  // Call the success callback if the password is correct
} else {
    onFailure();  // Call the failure callback if the password is incorrect
}</code></pre>
<p>} ```</p>

<h2>Event Handling | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/event-handling</p>
<p>With YOM you can build custom web widgets that communicate directly
with the stream via the <code>postToYOM</code> function:</p>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>postToYOM('AdjustSetting', {settingValue: 'newValue'});</code></p>
<p>This function facilitates sending commands or adjustments to the
stream. Do ensure you <a href="/build/ue5/registering-events">register
events</a> inside of your game project, to bind the events to certain
functions.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>We assume you have 3 buttons on your webpage (<code>#spawnBot</code>,
<code>#removeBot</code>, <code>#clearBot</code>). On click we can
trigger content within the stream using the <code>postToYOM</code>
function:</p>
<p>Copy</p>
<p>``` document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
document.getElementById('spawnBot').addEventListener('click', function()
{ postToYOM('SpawnBot', {amount: '1'}); });</p>
<pre><code>document.getElementById(&#39;removeBot&#39;).addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
    postToYOM(&#39;RemoveBot&#39;, {amount: &#39;1&#39;});
});

document.getElementById(&#39;clearBot&#39;).addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
    postToYOM(&#39;ClearBot&#39;, {});
});</code></pre>
<p>}); ```</p>
<h3>Listen for Events</h3>
<p>Using YOM SDK you can push events from the game to the web browser.
From there you can connect your own logic to it.</p>
<p>YOM SDK can <a href="/build/ue5/push-events">automatically push</a>
events to the data layer for GTM and GA integration. Configure your GTM
to capture these events for detailed interaction tracking.</p>

<h2>UE5 | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5</p>
<h2>Step 1: Use a C++ UE5 Project</h2>
<p>You need to use a C++ version of an UE5 project. This can be achieved
by setting up a new project and selecting C++ as the project defaults or
by converting your existing blueprint project to C++. There is no
disadvantage for picking C++ over Blueprints as you can still use
Blueprints throughout your project.</p>
<p>If you are converting from an existing project follow the following
steps to convert it to a C++ project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Tools -&gt; select "new C++ class"</li>
<li>Select none as the parent class and press next.</li>
<li>Press create and it will convert your Blueprint project to a C++
project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Add the SDK to the project</h2>
<p>To incorporate the necessary SDK into your project, follow these
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close your project if you opened it as part of the previous
step.</li>
<li>Navigate to your root project folder and create a new folder called
"Plugins". This folder will serve as the container for the required
plugins.</li>
<li>Obtain the YOM UE5 SDK for your Unreal Engine version from the <a
href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mv0RNi9jmkz9L3PJWQnSu5ey-2IJek1B?usp=sharing">link</a>.
If you don't have access, ask your YOM contact person. This will trigger
a download of a ZIP file. The ZIP file will contain three plugins.</li>
<li>Extract the zip file and copy and paste the three plugins into the
"Plugins" folder you need to create in your project directory. Ensure
that the plugins are directly placed inside the "Plugins" folder and not
within any additional subfolders.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>By following the steps outlined above, you should now have a folder
structure resembling the following:</p>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>- YourProject   - Plugins     - YOM     - GltfRuntime     - VaRest</code></p>
<h2>Step 3: Building the SDK</h2>
<p>Now that everything is set, boot your project and compile the plugin
headers. This need to be done once every time you update the SDK or add
any other plugin and requires using a C++ project with <a
href="/build/getting-started#checklist-before-you-start">Visual
Studio</a> installed. After it is set, it will automatically open the
project.</p>
<p>Opening the project for the first time can take a bit of time. Just
be patient. It will boot.</p>

<h2>Configure your Stream | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/configure-your-stream</p>
<p>This page will explain how to set up your game to work with the
features present in the YOM UE5 SDK and assumes a new project. For
existing projects, you may already have modified the GameMode and
PlayerController classes. To retain compatibility follow the following
guide.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Validate the SDK</h3>
<p>YOM SDK should be enabled by default. Validate by checking if a new
toolbar appeared in your navigation bar called 'YOM Toolbar'.</p>
<h4>Follow these steps if the toolbar did not appear:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Click on "Edit" and select "Plugins" from the dropdown menu. This
will open the Plugins window.</li>
<li>In the search bar within the Plugins window, type 'YOM' to search
for the YOM Replicator SDK plugin.</li>
<li>Enable it. If the plugin does not appear, try restarting the editor
and repeat this step.</li>
<li>Do the same for GltfRuntime and VaRest plugins in the same manner
and enable them by clicking their respective checkboxes.</li>
<li>After enabling the plugins, it is recommended to restart the editor.
This allows Unreal to load the plugins properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Setting up the SDK</h3>
<p>To configure the YOM Replicator SDK for your metaverse project,
follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the setup screen by navigating to "Tools" in the top menu.
Select "YOM" and then choose "Setup Project." This will open the setup
window.</p></li>
<li><p>In the setup window, you will find several settings that need to
be configured. Here is an explanation of each setting:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Startup World</strong>: This setting sets the startup level.
When we make a build this will be the starting point. As example it can
be a mainmenu or if you don't have that the scene the game begins</li>
<li><strong>Game World</strong>: This setting sets the game level. This
is the level where the game takes place.</li>
<li><strong>Player Asset</strong>: This setting defines the asset that
players will control within the world. It can be any character or object
that allows player interaction. The default character provided by the
YOM plugin is the Yom_BP_ThirdPersonCharacter. Change it from "None" to
"Yom_BP_ThirdPersonCharacter".</li>
<li><strong>Playercontroller asset:</strong> The Playercontroller that
is used the game world or you want to use in the game world.</li>
<li><strong>GameMode asset</strong>: The GameMode that is used the game
world or you want to use in the game world.</li>
<li><strong>Webserver path</strong>: The path to the webserver you want
to use. We already profite a example webserver.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplayer project</strong>: If enabled, this setting
allows the code from the SDK to be multiplayer. Enable this if you
creating a game for multiplayer</li>
<li><strong>Voice Chat</strong>: If enabled, this setting allows players
to communicate with each other through voice chat within the
experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click "Begin Setup," and if the settings are correctly configured, a
message will appear in the bottom right corner, instructing you to
restart the editor. Click "Restart" to apply the changes.</p>
<p>In case you want to make any further adjustments or verify the setup,
you can run the setup tool again or manually modify the settings.</p>
<p>Validate your configuration</p>
<p>After restarting, navigate to Content Drawer -&gt; Content. You
should now see a MetaspaceGameMode and a MetaspacePlayer. These assets
can be used or extended to add further modifications and behavior to
your experience. Then navigate to Settings -&gt; World Settings, then
validate the GameMode as shown in the provided screenshot.</p>
<p><em>Note that the Default Pawn Class in the MetaspaceGameMode is
intentionally set to None, as the pawn will be loaded into the game via
the MetaspacePlayer.</em></p>

<h2>Test your Stream | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/test-your-stream</p>
<p>To test your game locally you can do this in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stream to localhost:8888.</strong> This allows you to debug
the full web experience, including player authentication. This is the
default setting with all toggled turned off and is also the recommended
setting to playtest the full experience.</li>
<li><strong>Play it in viewport.</strong> If you want to quickly debug
locally and you want to bypass the authentication window, you can opt
for testing in the viewport. To enable this you need to toggle on 'Run
in Editor' and 'Auto Spawn Player'.</li>
<li><strong>Play in standalone.</strong> If you want to debug networking
features without needing to first pass the authentication window in the
web browser, you need to toggle on 'Auto Spawn Player'.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Toolbar</h2>
<p>For these things we made the YOM Toolbar to easily test your game. We
added some settings to help you test your game:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch Game.</strong> Launches the game with the below
settings.</li>
<li><strong>Run in Editor.</strong> When turned off it runs the game in
stand alone and starts the signaling server. When turned on it will run
the game in viewport and not start the signaling server.</li>
<li><strong>Respawn Player.</strong> When turned off it runs the game in
stand alone and starts the signaling server. When turned on it will run
the game in viewport and not start the signaling server.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Connect Player:</strong> When turned on it will execute
the connect logic as you would connect from the pixelstreamer</li>
<li><strong>Run Webserver:</strong> When turned on it will start the
webserver when we press launch game</li>
<li><strong>Run Webclient:</strong> When turned on it will start the
webclient when we press launch game</li>
<li><strong>Force Authentication.</strong> When true, if forces users to
authenticate with their wallet else it will not work.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Clients.</strong> You can select the number of
clients it needs to boot up. It will also boot up another signalling
server. You can connect to it by adding a port. 8888 is the first one
second 8889 etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The YOM Toolbar it to make it easy to test locally. You can still use
the default buttons to play the game and the settings will apply to
it.</p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>Pressing the Launch Stream button, the servers and games will boot
and you can debug your game within a webpage. Make sure to add a Player
Start to the level if the character does not spawn automatically.</p>

<h2>Responsive Design | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/responsive-design</p>
<p>In the era of multi-device gaming, it's crucial to ensure your game
is accessible and optimized for various platforms, including mobile
devices and tablets. While YOM uses pixel streaming to deliver
high-quality graphics across devices, understanding and adapting to
different screen sizes and input methods can greatly enhance the user
experience. Why implement responsive design:</p>
<ol>
<li>Broaden your audience by supporting multiple device types</li>
<li>Ensure consistent gameplay experience across platforms</li>
<li>Optimize UI and controls for touch-based interfaces</li>
<li>Improve accessibility for players with different device
preferences</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 1: Detect Mobile Devices</h2>
<p>YOM provides a built-in method to identify if a player is connecting
from a mobile device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access the YomGameInstanceSubsystem in your Blueprint or C++
code.</li>
<li>Check the "GetIsMobile" boolean.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 2: Adjust for Mobile</h2>
<p>Once you've detected a mobile device, you can make appropriate
adjustments :</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase button sizes for touch input</li>
<li>Implement different widget blueprints for mobile and desktop</li>
<li>Utilize Size Boxes and Scale Boxes for flexible layouts</li>
<li>Use anchors and alignment for position-independent layouts</li>
<li>Simplify certain menus for smaller screens</li>
<li>Implement touch-friendly controls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Test with Chrome's Device Mode</h2>
<p>To debug and test your mobile layout:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your game in Chrome</li>
<li>Press F12 to open Developer Tools</li>
<li>Click the "Toggle device toolbar" icon or press Ctrl+Shift+M</li>
<li>Select different device presets or set custom dimensions</li>
<li>Test your game's responsiveness in real-time</li>
</ol>
<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>By implementing these responsive design techniques, your YOM-powered
game will provide a smooth, adaptable experience across a wide range of
devices, from high-end desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p><em>Note: Always test your responsive design on actual devices when
possible, as emulators may not perfectly replicate real-world
conditions.</em></p>

<li>When you have variables that need to be passed in your function you
can already define what names they have so it will show up in the
godmode.</li>
<li>You need to create a array and add the amount of variables you have
to that.</li>
<li>Param Name: name of the param variable.</li>
<li>Default Value: the value it needs to have or has at the start.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: The function input will be a Va Rest Json object, allowing
data to be sent with the event.</em></p>
<h2>Step 2: Handling Event Callback</h2>
<p>To process data that is sent with the event:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access the data object passed to the function</li>
<li>Use "get field by name and type" to retrieve specific variables</li>
<li>Implement your logic using the retrieved data</li>
<li>Note that everything we send will be a string and you need to
convert that to the type you need.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Push Events | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/push-events</p>
<p>The YOM SDK allows you to push your own custom events to the browser,
allowing communication between the Unreal client and the pixel streamer
/web browser. This guide explains how to set up, determine their event
scope, and use them.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Use PushYomEvent Function</h2>
<p>Once you have the YOMGameInstanceSubsystem, use the PushYomEvent
function:</p>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>YOMGameInstanceSubsystem-&gt;PushYomEvent(PEventScope, PFunction, PVariableNames, PVariableValues);</code></p>
<p>Use the "PushYomEvent" function with these parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: Name of the function to call</li>
<li>Variable Names: Array of variable names</li>
<li>Variable Values: Array of variable values</li>
<li>DataLayer: Boolean to determine whether the event should be <a
href="/build/getting-started/integrate-your-stream/event-handling#listen-for-events">automatically
pushed forwards to the DataLayer</a>, used by marketing and data
services Google Analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>By following these steps, you can push communication from your Unreal
Engine project to the pixelstreamer/web browser.</p>

<h2>Airdrops | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/airdrops</p>
<p>It is possible to incentivize and reward users in experiences by
dropping items directly to their wallet as part of the experience
mechanics. This should be done on the server side, and the player must
have a connected wallet for it to work. Make sure the inventory is set
up as well. In the airdrop node, you need to set two values:</p>
<ol>
<li>YomPlayer: Specify the player to whom the item will be
airdropped.</li>
<li>Item ID: Provide the ID of the item that will be airdropped. There
are separate IDs for devnet and mainnet.</li>
</ol>
<p>The airdrop node will add an item based on the item ID to the
player's wallet. Please note that the airdrop function will not work for
users who haven't logged in with a wallet.</p>
<h2><strong>Checking if airdrop received</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to check if a user has already received an airdrop, you
can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieve the YomPlayer of the player.</li>
<li>Get the inventory of the YomPlayer.</li>
<li>Check if there is an item in the inventory with the ID of your
master NFT ID. If an item with that ID exists, it means the user has
already received the airdrop.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blueprint to check if airdrop was received</p>
<h2><strong>Checking wallet connection</strong></h2>
<p>To check if a user has a wallet connected, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the player you want to check.</li>
<li>Retrieve the YomPlayer from that player.</li>
<li>Get the wallet of the YomPlayer.</li>
<li>Check if the wallet ID is empty. If it's not empty, it means the
user has a wallet connected.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blueprint to check wallet connection</p>
<h2><strong>Checking if wallet is fetched</strong></h2>
<p>Fetching the wallet may take some time, so there is a callback
function called "OnInventoryFetched" that you can use. To check if the
wallet has been fetched, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the YomPlayer from the player.</li>
<li>Check if the YomPlayer has a valid inventory.</li>
<li>Bind an event to the "OnInventoryFetched" callback to be notified
when the inventory is fetched.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blueprint to check if wallet is fetched</p>
<p>Note: Airdrops last until the maximum supply of the item has been
reached.</p>

<h2>Gated Access | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/gated-access</p>
<p>To create exclusivity and restrict access to experiences based on
specific item ownership in YOM, you can follow these steps:</p>
<h2>Step 1: Adding the Gated Access component:</h2>
<ul>
<li>By default, the Gated Access component (YomGatedAccess) should
already be connected to your Metaspace Player. If you don't see it as a
component, you'll need to add it manually.</li>
<li>To add the component, click on the "Add Component" button in the
blueprint editor and search for "Yom Gated Access." Add it to your
Metaspace Player blueprint.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Adding the Gated Access actor to the level:</h2>
<ul>
<li>To implement the Gated Access functionality, search for "Yom Gated
Access" in the Place Actors window and drag it into the level where you
want to create the restricted zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Setting the Gated Access Item ID:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Gated Access actor in the level.</li>
<li>Look for the "Item ID" property and insert the NFT address or master
ID of the NFT item that is required for access. Note that you have
separate IDs for devnet and mainnet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the Item ID for gated access</p>
<h2>Step 4: Setting up a Collision Layer:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set up a collision object channel for the Gated Access to work
properly.</li>
<li>Go to Project Settings and navigate to the Collision section.</li>
<li>Click on the "New Object Channel" button.</li>
<li>Name the channel as "GatedAccess" and set the default response to
"Overlap."</li>
</ul>
<p>Example gated access volume, only accessible when possessing a
certain Item</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can check if a player has access to the Gated Access zone by
calling the blueprint function "Can Player Access."</li>
<li>Make sure the inventory is enabled for the player for this
functionality to work.</li>
<li>The user's wallet needs to be fetched before they can go through the
Gated Access.</li>

<h2>Characters | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/characters</p>
<p>This guide explains how to create and customize a player character
for your YOM stream. It covers using YOM's pre-built character or
creating your own, understanding existing functionality, and how to
modify or extend character features.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Create Your Player Character</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a New Blueprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click in the Content Browser</li>
<li>Select "Blueprint Class"</li>
<li>Search for "Yom_BP_ThirdPersonCharacter" to use YOM's existing
character framework</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assign the Player Character:</p>
<ul>
<li>After creating your blueprint, assign it as the player character for
your project</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 2: Understand Yom_BP_ThirdPersonCharacter</h2>
<p>Yom_BP_ThirdPersonCharacter includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Movement controls (WASD keys)</li>
<li>Interaction system (E key, requires BP_Interact interface)</li>
<li>Camera movement (third-person and first-person)</li>
<li>Camera switching (Q key)</li>
<li>Crouching (C key)</li>
<li>Jumping (Spacebar)</li>
<li>Walking/Running toggle (Left Shift)</li>
<li>Touch support for mobile devices</li>
<li>Customizable settings (walk/run speed, starting view)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 3: Modify Functionality</h2>
<p>To customize Yom_BP_ThirdPersonCharacter:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Override the function you want to change</p></li>
<li><p>To add functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call the parent function</li>
<li>Add your custom logic</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To remove functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Override the function</li>
<li>Leave it empty</li>
<li>Do not call the parent function</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: Overriding</em> <strong><em>preserves</em></strong>
<em>changes during SDK updates</em></p>
<h2>Step 4: Manage Controls</h2>
<p>Default controls use Unreal's Enhanced Input System and are mapped to
a controls customization modal that end-users can alter from within the
stream:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To modify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your own "InputMappingContext" in the content folder</li>
<li>Add required defaults</li>
<li>Create new key mappings for your project</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Caution: Direct changes to default controls may be overwritten by
SDK updates</em></p>
<h2>Result:</h2>
<p>Following these steps allows you to create, customize, and manage
your player character while leveraging YOM's existing functionality and
maintaining compatibility with future updates.</p>

<h2>Control Hints | YOM Docs</h2>

<h2>Displaying the Control Hints Panel to the player's screen</h2>
<p>The YOM SDK allows creators to display a UI widget that would allow
the player to understand the basic game controls. This guide will
explain how to display and customize your own Control Hints with our
ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Adding Control Hints component</h3>
<p>To use the features of the Control Hints component, it needs to be
connected to your player. This should be done by default. However, if
you do not see YomControlHints under your player as a component, follow
this step. Otherwise, you can skip to step 2.</p>
<p>YomControlHints is a component therefore we need to add it to the
player blueprint. To add the component you will have to click add on
component menu and search for <code>Yom Control Hints</code>.</p>
<p>Pick YomControlHints Component</p>
<p>After this, you need to assign a widget to the YomControlHints
component. By default an existing widget should be already available,
otherwise you would have to create a one from scratch (step 2).</p>
<p>Pick YomControlHints Widget</p>
<h3>Example of ControlHints</h3>

<h2>Nameplates | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong>
https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/nameplates</p>
<h2>Adding a nameplate to your character</h2>
<p>The YOM SDK allows creators to design their own nameplates. This
guide will explain how to create and use your own nameplates with our
ecosystem. If you just want to use our default nameplates, but it has
not been enabled yet on your character you can move to Step 2 and use
the <code>YomDefaultNameplateWidget</code> as your widget.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Creating a custom nameplate</h3>
<p>To create a custom nameplate you will have to create a new blueprint
asset. Right-click in a folder in the <code>Content Browser</code> and
under <code>Create Basic Asset</code> click on
<code>Blueprint Class</code>.</p>
<p>Blueprint Class</p>
<p>This will open up the blueprint dialog box in which you can search
for <code>YomNameplateWidget</code>. Once you find the
<code>YomNameplateWidget</code> select it.</p>
<p>Pick YomNameplate</p>
<p>You can now customize your nameplate as you like, but one of the
widgets must be a <code>TextBlock</code> widget with the name
<code>WalletID</code>. In this <code>TextBlock</code> the walletID of
the players will be printed when they are loaded into the game. Also
give this walletID block a nice default name like <code>Unknown</code>
for when the nameplate could not be loaded.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Adding the nameplate to your character</h3>
<p>Open up your character (this is not your
<code>MetaspacePlayer</code>, but the character that the players will
use to move around with) and under the <code>Components</code> tab add a
<code>Widget</code> component.</p>
<p>Pick Widget Component</p>
<p>Give this widget a nice name like <code>Nameplate</code> and select
it. Under the
<code>Details -&gt; User Interface -&gt; Widget Class</code> you can set
your widget.</p>
<p>Select Widget Class</p>
<p>Tip: If you want the widget to always face the player, change
<code>Space</code> from <code>World</code> to <code>Screen</code>.</p>
<p>In the <code>Viewport</code> tab, set the nameplate to the desired
position for your character.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Add the YomNameplateManager to your MetaspacePlayer</h3>
<p>The nameplates will only work when you tell your
<code>MetaspacePlayer</code> to load the
<code>YomNameplateManager</code> in your game on startup. Go to your
<code>MetaspacePlayer</code> and under
<code>Details -&gt; Yom Player -&gt; Managers</code> add an element and
insert <code>YomNameplateManager</code>.</p>
<p>Add YomNameplate Manager</p>
<p>You should now be able to see a nameplate when you spawn into the
game.</p>

<h2>Counters | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/counters</p>
<h2>Adding a counter to your metaverse</h2>
<p>The YOM SDK allows creators to design their own counters. This guide
will explain how to create and use your own counters with our
ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Adding counter actor the the world</h3>
<p>To use the features of the counter, it needs to be added to the world
first.</p>
<p>YOM Counter is an actor and needs to be manually added to the world
to start working. To add the actor, you will have to slide the actor
from <code>Content Browser</code> under
<code>Plugins -&gt; YOM Content -&gt; Counter</code> into your
world.</p>
<p>After this, you can call counter functions through blueprints without
errors.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Adding counter component to the player</h3>
<p>To use the auto replicating feature of the counter (updating a
counter value is shared with other clients), you will need to add the
counter component to the player blueprint. You can do this by going to
your <code>MetaspacePlayer</code> and using the add button on the top
left corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Pick YomCounter Component</p>
<p>After you do this, you can define what to do when a counter value is
updated. This is done by using a callback event. This callback event
gives you the name of the counter which is updated and its new
value.</p>
<p>Yom Counter Updated</p>
<p>When a counter value is updated with <code>GetCounterPlayer</code>
blueprint function, this callback function will be called on all of the
clients with a counter component. Returned value and the name can be
used however you like.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Using blueprint functions to use the component</h3>
<p>From the blueprint actions box (it is automatically open or you
should right click to the screen), search for <code>Yom Counter</code>
in order to see the available functions.</p>
<p>Example use case for <code>Get Counter</code> function</p>
<p>Get Counter</p>
<p>In this example, we are trying to get <code>testCounter</code> in the
current metaspace. Counter value is returned by a callback therefore we
drag and drop P Callback node and create a custom event. P value
returned by the event is the value of the counter which can be used
however the user wants. In this example case it is printed to
development screen.</p>
<p>Create Callback Event</p>
<p>Example use case for <code>Add to Counter</code> function</p>
<p>Add to Counter</p>
<p>In this example, counter is set to increment the
<code>testCounter</code> in the current metaspace by value 1. Therefore,
this will increment that counter value by 1. P Callback function is the
function which is returned after API Request is done. It can be used to
execute more commands when your increment/decrement request is done.</p>
<p>If callback function is not required, a dummy callback function can
be created as it can be seen from the image.</p>
<p>Finally, we can use <code>Get Counter Player</code> blueprint
function in order to replicate the get request of the counter value.
When it is called from a client, it makes a server call which is
replicated to other clients as well. This way, all of the connected
clients are getting the new value of the counter as well as the name of
the counter.</p>
<p>Example use case for <code>Get Counter Player</code> function</p>
<p>Get Counter Player</p>
<p>Note: we recommend not updating the counter too much, but 'batch' the
counts, as everytime the counter is updated it needs to be updated on
the blockchain, which costs money.</p>

<h2>Inventory | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/inventory</p>
<h2>Setting up an inventory</h2>
<p>The YOM plugin allows creators to completely design their own
inventory system. This guide will explain how to create your own
inventory system and how to use your own inventory system in your
metaspace.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Creating your own buttons</h3>
<p>The inventory system consists of buttons that can be pressed to spawn
items. A single button needs to be designed for the system to work. To
create a button you will have to create a new blueprint asset.
Right-click in a folder in the <code>Content Browser</code> and under
<code>Create Basic Asset</code> click on
<code>Blueprint Class</code>.</p>
<p>Blueprint Class</p>
<p>This will open up the blueprint dialog box in which you can search
for <code>YomButton</code>. Once you find the <code>YomButton</code>
select it.</p>
<p>Pick YomButton</p>
<p>Name the button something like <code>MyButton</code> and open up the
blueprint by double-clicking the new asset. In the blueprint editor, you
will now have an empty screen, in which you will have to design your
button. But before you start the button will need some widgets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Canvas</code> (<code>Overlay</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>The canvas in which the button can be built</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>Button</code> (<code>Button</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>The button that can be clicked</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>RarityWidget</code> (Any Widget)</p>
<ul>
<li>The rarity widget, can be seen as the border around the button</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>LoadingWidget</code> (Any Widget)</p>
<ul>
<li>The widget that is shown when the item is being loaded</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these widgets also need to have the name of the items
described above. In the default <code>YomButton</code> the hierarchy
looks like this:</p>
<p>YomButton Hierarchy</p>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set the visibility of the RarityWidget to
<code>Not Hit-Testable (Self &amp; All Children)</code> by clicking on
the RarityWidget in the hierarchy and going to
<code>Details -&gt; Behavior -&gt; Visibility</code>. This prevents the
Rarity widget from 'overlapping' the button which would prevent a user
from pressing the button.</li>
<li>Design your button with a fixed size this will prevent the buttons
from 'stretching' when loaded</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Creating your own Inventory Widget</h3>
<p>Create another blueprint like in step 1, but this should have
<code>YomPlayerInventoryWidget</code> selected.</p>
<p>Pick YomPlayerInventory</p>
<p>Give this a name as well like <code>MyPlayerInventoryWidget</code>
and open up the blueprint by double clicking the new asset. This will
again give you an empty screen. On this screen, you can design your
layout of the inventory. It will need one widget:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BaseButtonWidget (A widget with slots for other widgets like the
<code>Scroll Box</code>)</p>
<ul>
<li>In this widget, your buttons will be created</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The hierarchy of the default <code>InventoryWidget</code> looks like
this:</p>
<p>InventoryWidget Hierarchy</p>
<p>Furthermore, your <code>MyPlayerInventoryWidget</code> needs to have
some settings applied to it before it works. Click on
<code>MyPlayerInventoryWidget</code> in the hierarchy and go to
<code>Details -&gt; Yom Inventory</code>. Here you will see the
following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Yom Button Widget</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The widget for your button, set this to the button you created in
step 1.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>Base Button Widget</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This one should be set to the <code>BaseButtonWidget</code> in the
hierarchy, but if it is not set, you can set it here</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>Start Button Amount</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This value tells the inventory system how many buttons it should
spawn when the player is connected. If the player has more items than
this amount more buttons will be loaded.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that players could have more items in their inventory
than you expect. Your inventory should not deform when a lot of items
are being loaded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Creating a component</h3>
<p>Create another blueprint like in step 1, but this should have
<code>YomInventoryComponent</code> selected.</p>
<p>Pick YomInventoryComponent</p>
<p>Give this a name as well like <code>MyInventory</code> and open up
the blueprint by double clicking the new asset. In the asset, you will
have to set one setting. Go to
<code>Details -&gt; Yom Inventory Component -&gt; Inventory Widget</code>
and set it to the widget you created in Step 2</p>
<h3>Step 4: Setting your inventory in your player</h3>
<p>Open your <code>MetaspacePlayer</code> and under components remove
<code>YomDefaultInventory</code> if present. Then add the component that
you created in step 3. When you start the game now you can see your own
inventory in action when pressing 'I' while playing.</p>

<h2>Portals | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/build/ue5/portals</p>
<h2>Adding a portal to your Stream</h2>
<p>The YOM SDK allows creators to design their own portals. This guide
will explain how to create and use your own portals with our ecosystem.
If you just want to use our default portals, you can use the portals in
the <code>Content Browser</code> under
<code>Plugins -&gt; YOM Content -&gt; Portals</code> and skip to step 2.
The portals that you can use are the <code>YomDefaultPortal</code> and
the <code>YomFXPortal</code>, where the <code>YomFXPortal</code> is more
visually appealing. Note that you must have the option
<code>Allow teleporting</code> set to true, you can verify this by going
into your <code>MetaspacePlayer</code> and checking if it has a
<code>YomPortallingComponent</code>.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Creating a Custom portal</h3>
<p>To create a custom portal you will have to create a new blueprint
asset. Right-click in a folder in the <code>Content Browser</code> and
under <code>Create Basic Asset</code> click on
<code>Blueprint Class</code>.</p>
<p>Blueprint Class</p>
<p>This will open op the blueprint dialog box in which you can search
for <code>YomPortal</code>. Once you find the <code>YomPortal</code>
class select it.</p>
<p>Pick YomPortal</p>
<p>You can now start to customize the portal in every way you like. If
you want the plugin to automatically set the material you must set
<code>Details -&gt; Auto Set Portal Material</code> to true and the
portal must have a <code>StaticMeshComponent</code> called
<code>PortalDisplay</code>, this will automatically edit the material of
the <code>StaticMeshComponent</code> at runtime when you connect to a
different stream. If you want to set the material yourself you can use
the <code>Get Portal Material</code> node in the
<code>Event On Portal Open</code> and <code>Event On Portal Close</code>
events. Furthermore the portal will need a <code>Collision</code>
component for triggering the portal behaviour and you can set a default
material under <code>Details -&gt; Materials</code> for when the portal
is not connected.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Adding the portal to your level</h3>
<p>You can now add the newly created portal to your level by taking it
from the <code>Content Browser</code> and sliding it into your
level.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Adding a button to your level</h3>
<p>In this step we will describe how to create your own button, if you
want to use a default button created by YOM please use the
<code>YomDefaultPortalButton</code>, which works by pressing
<code>E</code> in front of the button and go to step 4.</p>
<p>To create your own button we will have to create a blueprint.
Right-click in a folder in the <code>Content Browser</code> and under
<code>Create Basic Asset</code> click on
<code>Blueprint Class</code>.</p>
<p>Blueprint Class</p>
<p>This will open op the blueprint dialog box, in this box click on
<code>Actor</code>.</p>
<p>Pick Actor</p>
<p>Open up the blueprint and add a collision (we use
<code>Box Collision</code>).</p>
<p>Pick Box Collision</p>
<p>Click on the new collision component and under
<code>Details -&gt; Events</code> click on the <code>+</code> sign on
the <code>On Component Begin Overlap</code>.</p>
<p>Pick OnComponentBeginOverlap</p>
<p>This will now open the event graph. Under <code>Variables</code>
press the <code>+</code> sign and add the following two variables:</p>
<p>Setup PortalButtonVariables</p>
<p>Note that you will have to set the types of the variables yourself,
and that the 'eye' needs to be open.</p>
<p>After this setup your graph like this:</p>
<p>OpenPortalGraph</p>
<p>You have now created a button that can open a portal when a player
runs into the box.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Adding the button to your level</h3>
<p>You can now add the newly created button to your level by taking it
from the <code>Content Browser</code> and sliding it into your
level.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Opening the portal</h3>
<p>In the <code>Outliner</code> find the button that you just put into
your level. In the <code>Details</code> panel of this actor you can now
find the <code>Portal</code> and <code>Url</code> variables that you
created. In the portal set the portal that you added to the level in
step 2. The url of the portal should be a valid url to another
stream.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Checking the images that are generated</h3>
<p>If you start the game now, trigger the button and walk over to your
portal you will see the image of your stream in the portal. Furthermore,
a directory called <code>PortalImages</code> is added to your project

<h2>Overview | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/earn/overview</p>
<p>In the YOM ecosystem, <strong>nodes</strong> are the backbone of a
distributed cloud gaming platform. Unlike traditional crypto ‚Äúnodes‚Äù
that often sit idle or rely on speculative token emissions, YOM nodes
perform <strong>real work</strong> ‚Äì streaming live 3D game sessions to
users ‚Äì and <strong>get paid based on actual usage.</strong></p>
<p>This chapter provides a comprehensive look at how YOM nodes function,
how rewards are calculated, and how node operators can maximize their
earnings. We‚Äôll also explore practical examples and best practices,
presented in a narrative yet professional tone to guide even first-time
participants through the technical details.</p>
<h2>What is a Node and How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>A YOM node is essentially a slice of a gaming computer or server
dedicated to running a cloud gaming session for a player‚Äã. When a player
launches a game through YOM‚Äôs platform, the game is actually rendered on
a node operator‚Äôs hardware and streamed to the player‚Äôs device in
real-time. Each node in the network streams a AAA game to a single
concurrent player.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, running a YOM node is akin to hosting a small game
server that <em>one player connects to for a session</em>, except the
player only sees the video feed. Because YOM is decentralized, these
nodes aren‚Äôt in a corporate data center ‚Äì they‚Äôre run by everyday
operators on their own hardware. Every time content is streamed or
rendered by your node, you get paid for that session.</p>
<p>Anyone can run a YOM node, provided they obtain a node license and
have access to suitable hardware or cloud infrastructure. A node license
is essentially an access token (often an NFT or code) that registers you
as an official node operator in the network. Once you have a license,
you can choose how to deploy your node: either self-hosted on your own
PC/rig or delegated to a verified Node-as-a-Service provider who runs
the node on your behalf‚Äã.</p>
<h2>How Many Nodes per Machine?</h2>
<p>Notably, one physical machine can run <strong>multiple node
instances</strong> (multiple licenses) in parallel if it has enough
resources. YOM‚Äôs software modularizes nodes as containers or processes,
each serving a different gamer. For example, a powerful GPU like an
NVIDIA RTX 4080 can host about <strong>5 concurrent game
sessions</strong> by running 5 node licenses simultaneously on the same
rig. In fact, each PC can run up to <em>8 nodes at once</em> with the
plug-and-play YOM setup</p>
<p>This means an operator with a high-end system can multiply their
earnings by supporting several players at the same time using a single
machine (essentially slicing their GPU/CPU to create multiple nodes).
YOM‚Äôs recent node model update was designed to leverage this: by
decoupling licenses from hardware, a single expensive GPU can replace
what previously required multiple separate rigs. As a result, the
network became more scalable and accessible ‚Äì operators with modest
setups can start with one or two licenses, while those with beefier
hardware can <strong>scale up</strong> by adding more licenses to fully
utilize their machine.</p>
<h2>How Node Rewards Work</h2>
<p><strong>YOM‚Äôs reward model is session-based and
usage-driven</strong>, aligning incentives with real player activity.
This is a key differentiator from many crypto networks that simply act
as token farms. Instead, YOM nodes earn in proportion to the gaming
sessions they host and continuously attract buying demand.</p>
<p>Every game session your node hosts earns you a fixed reward. Each
session typically lasts around 10 minutes and includes a brief
advertisement, generating consistent revenue. More sessions translate
directly into higher earnings. Let‚Äôs break down how the rewards are
calculated:</p>
<h3>Regional Modifiers</h3>
<p>Advertising rates vary globally. YOM accounts for regional
differences in ad revenue (CPM) and operating costs to ensure fair
compensation:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-Value Regions: Operators in markets with strong advertising
demand (e.g., North America, Western Europe) receive proportionally
higher per-session payouts.</li>
<li>Cost-of-Living Factors: For regions with lower ad rates but also
reduced electricity or bandwidth costs, the network adjusts rewards to
remain competitive and profitable for local operators.</li>
</ul>
<p>By tuning rewards daily to reflect changing CPMs or electricity
expenses, YOM ensures a stable earning environment for operators
worldwide.</p>
<h3>Workload Modifiers</h3>
<p>Games that are poorly optimized or highly graphically intensive
consume more processing power. Additionally, streaming at <strong>4K, 60
FPS</strong>, or handling popular AAA titles can dramatically increase
GPU usage. The simplified reward formula is:</p>
<p>Copy</p>
<p><code>Total YOM/hour = Base Reward √ó Streaming Difficulty Multiplier √ó Regional Modifier</code></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Reward</strong> corresponds to the session-based ad
revenue (aiming for ~$0.30/hour).</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty Multiplier</strong> reflects game intensity or
stream quality settings.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Modifier</strong> adjusts for advertising CPM and
local operating costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In simpler terms, <strong>your node earns more for harder
work</strong>. This dynamic reward component incentivizes operators to
accept and successfully run even the most demanding game sessions, since
those yield higher returns. It also motivates game developers to
optimize their content (because highly unoptimized content costs more to
stream), balancing the ecosystem‚Äôs efficiency.</p>
<h2>Earnings Expectations: Practical Examples</h2>
<p>One of the most common questions potential node operators ask is
‚Äú<strong>How much can I earn?</strong>‚Äù. YOM provides a realistic
forecast by modeling node earnings as a <strong>Gaussian (bell curve)
distribution</strong> centered around an expected average.</p>
<p>The assumption is that on <strong>average, a node will be utilized
about 50% of the time</strong> it‚Äôs available‚Äã. In other words, roughly
half the hours your node is up, it will be actively streaming a session
(the other half it might be idle, waiting for demand). Based on network
simulations under current conditions, YOM estimates the following
monthly earnings per node (for one license running full-time):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average Monthly Earnings:</strong> $77 per node (assuming
50% workload allocation).</li>
<li><strong>Lower Bound (-1 SD):</strong> $32 per node, reflecting
minimal workload assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Upper Bound (+1 SD):</strong> $121 per node, representing
optimal demand and performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures give a <strong>typical range</strong> for a single node
license‚Äôs monthly income. The distribution is roughly bell-shaped,
meaning most months you can expect to be somewhere around the middle of
this range, with occasional dips toward the low end or spikes toward the
high end.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that <strong>these numbers scale linearly with the
number of node licenses you run on your hardware</strong> (assuming your
machine can handle it). For example, if you operate a rig with <strong>5
licenses concurrently (e.g. a high-end GPU running five game
streams)</strong>, your projected earnings would be about five times the
single-node values. Concretely, <em>five</em> nodes could yield around
<strong>$385 per month on average</strong>, with a lower-bound near $160
and an upper-bound around $605.</p>
<p>YOM also offers a <strong>minimum earnings guarantee</strong> of
$10.80/month per node if your node remains consistently available (6
hours daily) but receives no sessions, ensuring a baseline reward.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting More Work: Maximizing Workload
Allocation</strong></h2>
<p>Understanding <strong>how the YOM network distributes
workload</strong> is crucial, because it directly affects your earnings.
While node rewards are fixed per region, the key to increasing total
earnings lies in securing more workload by optimizing several factors
that influence allocation. Workload distribution is determined by a
combination of <strong>demand-driven factors</strong> and
<strong>operator performance metrics.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reputation:</strong> High uptime, reliability, and active
community engagement (accumulating XP through staking and active
participation) significantly boost your node‚Äôs priority.</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Nodes offering low ping and stable
connections are preferred for session assignments. Improve this by
hosting your node close to target players and using a reliable wired
internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Time-of-Day:</strong> Gaming demand peaks evenings and
weekends. Ensuring your node is available during these periods increases
your likelihood of receiving session assignments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the above factors, YOM‚Äôs orchestrator also performs some
balancing to prevent any single node from hogging all jobs or remaining
completely idle for too long. If two nodes are equally qualified to take
a session (similar latency and reputation), the network might rotate
assignments to spread out earnings. Likewise, during periods of
<strong>low overall demand</strong>, not every node can be busy 50%+ of
the time ‚Äì some will sit idle. In such cases, the system may cycle
through available nodes so that each gets at least a few sessions
instead of one node taking them all. This balancing act is also
constrained by <em>regional demand</em>: a surplus of nodes in one
region won‚Äôt help another region‚Äôs users. Thus, part of being a node
operator is understanding the supply-demand in your chosen region and
possibly adapting (which we‚Äôll address in the next section on increasing
your workload).</p>
<h3>Practical Steps to Increase Earnings</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize for Uptime:</strong> Aim for 99%+ uptime. Utilize
reliable hardware, power backups, and monitoring tools to maintain
consistent availability.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Deployment:</strong> Deploy nodes in high-value or
underserved regions to capture higher session volumes and per-session
rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Scale Smartly:</strong> Add additional node licenses as your
hardware comfortably allows, maximizing GPU usage and total
earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Engage Actively:</strong> Participate in community events
and stake earned $YOM tokens to boost your node's reputation, placing
you at the front of the line for session allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment Options: Self-Hosting vs. Node-as-a-Service</h2>
<p>Choose based on your technical comfort and desired level of
involvement. Many operators use a hybrid approach for convenience and to
max out profitability.</p>

<h2>Conclusion &amp; Best Practices Summary</h2>
<p>Running a YOM node is a practical opportunity to earn steady passive
income from real-world gaming activity. Remember these best
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain high uptime and reliability.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Optimize latency and connectivity.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Target high-demand periods and regions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Actively manage your node reputation and XP.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these strategies ‚Äì from technical tuning to strategic
planning ‚Äì you can <strong>maximize your node‚Äôs workload</strong>. The
result is not only higher earnings but also a more resilient and
valuable network. YOM‚Äôs model explicitly <strong>rewards performance and
active contribution</strong>, so operators who put in the effort to
optimize will see that reflected in their revenue. The network is still
young, which means early and proactive participants can carve out a
strong position as ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù nodes as demand scales up.</p>

<p>Delegating your node to a <strong>Node-as-a-Service (NaaS)</strong>
provider is the easiest and most convenient way to participate in the
YOM network and earn passive income. With delegation, you don't need to
worry about technical complexities such as setup, monitoring, and
maintenance. Instead, a trusted NaaS provider takes care of everything
while you enjoy consistent earnings from your node.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Choose Delegation?</strong></h3>
<p>Delegating your node provides several advantages, making it the
perfect choice for users who prefer a hands-off approach. Key Benefits
of Delegation:</p>

<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> No technical knowledge required‚Äîjust
delegate and start earning.</li>
<li><strong>Hassle-Free Scaling:</strong> Easily expand by purchasing
and delegating additional node licenses without worrying about hardware
capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Managed Service:</strong> A Node-as-a-Service (NaaS)
provider takes care of setup, monitoring, and maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable Earnings:</strong> Enjoy stable, passive income
without the need for active involvement.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Risk Exposure:</strong> No hardware investments or
operational risks associated with self-hosting.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Acquire a Node</strong></h3>
<p>Before you can delegate your node, you need to acquire
one<strong>.</strong> Owning a node grants you access to the YOM network
and allows you to delegate your node to a NaaS provider. How to Purchase
a Node License:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Visit the app.yom.net/nodes/sales:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase a node license (NFT) via YOM‚Äôs trusted partners.</li>
<li>Ensure that the seller is a verified YOM partner to avoid fraudulent
transactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Store Your License Securely:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once purchased, transfer the Node NFT to your Web3 wallet (e.g.,
MetaMask).</li>
<li>Ensure you back up your wallet's recovery phrase securely.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Delegating Your Node</strong></h3>
<p>After obtaining your Node License, follow these steps to delegate
your node to a NaaS provider and start earning:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Access the YOM Webapp:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <a
href="https://app.yom.net"><strong>app.yom.net</strong></a> and connect
your Web3 wallet that holds the Node NFT.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Navigate to the Node Management Section:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the dashboard, find the <strong>"Node Management"</strong>
tab.</li>
<li>Select the node license you wish to delegate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Choose a NaaS Provider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Browse through the list of available Node-as-a-Service
providers.</li>
<li>Evaluate providers based on their uptime guarantees, historical
performance, and service fees.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Confirm Delegation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>‚ÄúDelegate‚Äù</strong> button and confirm the
transaction in your Web3 wallet.</li>
<li>Once confirmed, your node will be handed over to the NaaS provider
for management.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Monitoring Your Delegated Node</strong></h3>
<p>Once your node is successfully delegated, you can monitor its
performance through the YOM dashboard. The dashboard provides valuable
insights, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earnings Overview:</strong> Track your daily, weekly, and
monthly rewards based on workload allocations.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> See how well your node is
performing in terms of uptime and resource allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboard Ranking:</strong> Monitor your rank and
reputation in the network based on $YRX accumulation and
performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Earnings and Payouts</strong></h3>
<p>With delegation, you can expect monthly earnings within an estimated
range of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$32 to $121 per month per node,</strong> depending on
network activity and workload saturation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Earnings vary based on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The overall demand for cloud gaming sessions.</li>
<li>Regional network saturation and available workload.</li>
<li>Your accumulated XP score, which influences workload priority.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Payouts are processed automatically</strong> at the end
of each earning period and distributed directly to your Web3
wallet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Step 5: Expanding Your Delegation Portfolio</strong></h3>
<p>Once you are comfortable with delegation, you can increase your
earning potential by acquiring and delegating additional nodes. This
allows you to benefit from multiple revenue streams with minimal
effort.</p>
<h4><strong>To scale up your earnings:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>Purchase additional node licenses from the YOM marketplace.</li>
<li>Follow the same delegation process via the dashboard.</li>
<li>Monitor multiple nodes and optimize your delegation strategy.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Can I switch to self-hosting later if I change my
mind?</strong> Yes, you can revoke delegation at any time and transition
to self-hosting if you prefer a more hands-on approach.</p>
<p><strong>2. What happens if my NaaS provider underperforms?</strong>
If your provider fails to meet uptime and performance standards, you can
re-delegate your node to another provider via the YOM dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>3. Are there any fees associated with delegation?</strong>
NaaS providers may charge a small service fee, which is deducted from
your monthly earnings. Be sure to check provider details before
delegation.</p>
<p><strong>4. How secure is the delegation process?</strong> The
delegation process is secured through blockchain smart contracts,
ensuring transparency and immutability. Your Node NFT remains safely
stored in your wallet.</p>

redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of
intellectual property or licence rights), right to receive accounts,
financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition
or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a

interest in the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective
affiliates.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the $YOM distribution, users have no economic or
legal right over or beneficial interest in the assets of the Company,
the Distributor, or any of their affiliates after the token
distribution.</p>
<p>To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading $YOM does
develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the
Company, the Distributor, the distribution of $YOM and YOM. Neither the
Company nor the Distributor will create such secondary markets nor will
either entity act as an exchange for $YOM.</p>

design, music, video, art or other media displayed in your digital asset
NFTs, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<h3>5. DISCLAIMERS</h3>
<p>Except as expressly provided to the contrary in writing by YOM, the
Service and content contained therein, and crypto assets listed therein
are provided on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù basis without warranties
or conditions of any kind, either express or implied.</p>
<p>YOM makes no warranty that the Service:</p>
<p>a) will meet your requirements;</p>
<p>b) will be available on an uninterrupted and timely basis.</p>
<p>YOM disclaims all other warranties or conditions, express or implied,
including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability, fitness for particular purpose, title and
non-infringement to the Service, as well to the content published
therein.</p>
<p>While YOM attempts to make your access to and use of the service and
content safe, you accept the inherent security risks of providing
information and dealing online over the internet and will not hold YOM
responsible for any breach of security unless it is due to our gross
negligence.</p>
<p>YOM shall not be responsible or liable to you for any loss and take
no responsibility for, and shall not be liable to you for any use of
crypto assets, including but not limited to any losses, damages or
claims arising from:</p>
<p>a) user error, such as forgotten passwords, incorrectly contruced
transactions, or mistyped addresses;</p>
<p>b) server failure or data loss;</p>
<p>c) corrupted wallet files;</p>
<p>d) unauthorized access to applications;</p>
<p>e) any unauthorized third party activities; including, without
limitation, the use of viruses, phishing, brute forcing, or other means
of attack against the service or crypto assets.</p>
<p>Crypto assets are intangible digital assets. They exist only by
virtue of the ownership record maintained in a blockchain. Any transfer
of title that might occur in any unique digital asset occurs on the
decentralized ledger within the blockchain. YOM does not guarantee that
YOM can effect the transfer of title or right in any crypto assets.</p>
<p>However, YOM requests its users who register as creators to warrant
that the crypto assets they mint as NFTs and list through YOM are their
own individual creations, which have not previously been published
and/or exploited in any manner, in order for them to comply with these
Terms, under liability to YOM and other users.</p>
<p>YOM is not responsible for sustained casualties due to vulnerability
or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g., wallet,
smart contract), blockchains or any other features of crypto assets. YOM
is not responsible for casualties due to late report by developers or
representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the blockchain
supporting crypto assets including forks, technical node issues or any
other issues having fund losses as a result.</p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability of either
party for fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation
of laws, or any other activity that cannot be limited or excluded by
legitimate means.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties
in contracts with consumers, so the above exclusion may not apply to
you.</p>
<h3>6. ASSUMPTION OF RISKS</h3>
<p>You accept and acknowledge:</p>
<p>a) The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.
Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and
adversely affect the crypto assets, which may also be subject to
significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of
crypto assets will not lose money.</p>
<p>b) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes
apply to your crypto assets transactions. YOM is not responsible for
determining the taxes that apply to crypto assets transactions.</p>
<p>c) There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency,
including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and
Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and
the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that
YOM shall not be responsible for any communication failures,
disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using
the crypto assets, however caused.</p>
<p>d) A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development
of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of
those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also
negatively impact the potential utility or value of crypto assets.</p>
<p>e) The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or
policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service
and the utility of crypto assets.</p>
<p>f) There are risks associated with purchasing user generated content,
including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets,
mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets
on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable.
YOM reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets
affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase
may become inaccessible on YOM. Under no circumstances shall the
inability to view your assets on YOM serve as grounds for a claim
against YOM.</p>
<h3>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall YOM be
liable to you or any third party for any lost profit or any indirect,
consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages
arising from these terms, the Service, or for any damages related to
loss of revenue, loss of profit, loss of business or anticipated
savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, or loss of data, and whether
caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or
otherwise.</p>
<p>The access to and use of the Services are at your own discretion and
risk, and you shall be solely responsible for any damage to your
computer system or mobile device or loss of data resulting
therefrom.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event shall the maximum aggregate liability of YOM arising out of or in
any way related to these terms, the access to and use of the service,
content, crypto assets, or any products or services purchased on the
service exceed the greater of:</p>
<p>a) the amount received by YOM from the sale of crypto assets that are
the subject of the claim, and</p>

<h2>FAQ | YOM Docs</h2>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> https://docs.yom.net/about/faq</p>
<h3><strong>1. General Questions</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>What is YOM?</strong></h4>
<p>YOM is a <strong>decentralized cloud gaming infrastructure
(DePIN)</strong> that allows users to stream immersive gaming
experiences to any device without the need for expensive hardware. YOM
connects idle GPU resources from self-hosted and delegated nodes to
studios, brands, and broadcasters, offering scalable, cost-efficient
cloud gaming solutions.</p>
<h4><strong>How does YOM work?</strong></h4>
<p>YOM utilizes a decentralized network of gaming machines (nodes)
running our custom <strong>Node OS</strong>, which stream gaming
sessions to end users. Studios and brands pay for these services, and
node operators earn rewards in $YOM tokens for providing computing
resources.</p>
<h4><strong>Who can benefit from YOM?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Node Operators:</strong> Earn passive income by contributing
GPU resources to the network.</li>
<li><strong>Community Members:</strong> Participate in governance, earn
XP rewards, and engage with the ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Studios &amp; Brands:</strong> Leverage YOM to provide
immersive, high-quality experiences to their audiences at a fraction of
traditional cloud gaming costs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>2. Node Operators</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>How can I start running a YOM node?</strong></h4>
<p>You can start by choosing one of two options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Delegation (Hands-off approach):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase a node license for $199 and delegate it to a
Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) provider.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Hosting (Hands-on approach):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase a <strong>plug-and-play device</strong> or set up the node
via a <strong>manual code installation</strong> on your gaming rig.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>What are the hardware requirements for
self-hosting?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Any NVIDIA RTX config (2060RTX and higher)
with high VRAM to maximize node capacity.</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9 for better
multitasking and stability.</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB would be sufficient on low config setups,
but 32GB+ is recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> No storage needed for plug n play
solution. For custom Linux boot deployment: 1TB+ available space
needed.</li>
<li><strong>Internet:</strong> Wired Ethernet connection (min 25mbps
upload).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How much can I earn by running a node?</strong></h4>
<p>Earnings depend on workload demand and regional factors. On
average:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Bound (-1 SD):</strong> $32 per node/month</li>
<li><strong>Average:</strong> $77 per node/month</li>
<li><strong>Upper Bound (+1 SD):</strong> $121 per node/month</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Earnings assume 50% workload utilization across different demand
periods.</em></p>
<h4><strong>What is the difference between delegation and
self-hosting?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegation:</strong> Fully managed by a NaaS provider, with
minimal effort required. Lower technical involvement but lower
optimization potential.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Hosting:</strong> Provides full control over operations
and the potential for higher earnings with greater responsibility for
setup and maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What costs should I consider when
self-hosting?</strong></h4>
<p>Costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware acquisition:</strong> New rigs vs. using existing
setups.</li>
<li><strong>Electricity costs:</strong> Managing power efficiency for
profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling costs:</strong> Adding more node licenses to
increase earnings.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Studios &amp; Brands</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Why should I use YOM for cloud gaming?</strong></h4>
<p>YOM offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Reduce cloud gaming costs from
$6/hour to $0.30/hour.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Access a global network of nodes
without infrastructure investment.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Integration:</strong> Embed streams directly into
websites, apps, and platforms with a single line of code.</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong> Implement branding, analytics, and
monetization strategies easily.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How is game performance ensured across different
devices?</strong></h4>
<p>YOM uses an <strong>AI-powered Resource Orchestrator</strong> that
dynamically selects the best nodes based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latency:</strong> Ensuring the lowest possible ping.</li>
<li><strong>Node Reputation:</strong> Prioritizing high-performing nodes
with good uptime.</li>
<li><strong>Game Availability:</strong> Allocating nodes with pre-loaded
game assets for faster deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What pricing model does YOM use?</strong></h4>
<p>YOM follows a <strong>session-based pricing model</strong>, where
studios pay:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$0.05 per gaming session</strong> (based on an average
10-minute session).</li>
<li><strong>$89/month base fee</strong> for access to analytics and
dashboard services.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How does advertising impact earnings and
costs?</strong></h4>
<p>The YOM ecosystem integrates advertising seamlessly into gaming
sessions. Studios benefit by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging <strong>pre-session ads</strong> that align with their
goals.</li>
<li>Receiving a revenue share from ad impressions during gameplay.</li>
<li>Reducing costs via ad-supported models while maintaining player
engagement.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>4. Tokenomics &amp; Rewards</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>What is $YOM and how does it work?</strong></h4>
<p>$YOM is the native utility token of the YOM ecosystem, used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying for cloud gaming services.</li>
<li>Rewarding node operators for their contribution.</li>
<li>Staking to earn additional rewards.</li>
<li>Ensuring network security and sustainability through a
<strong>deflationary model</strong> (5% burn on usage).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is XP and its role in the ecosystem?</strong></h4>
<p>XP is a <strong>soul-bound value</strong> that represents user
contributions and engagement in the ecosystem. It is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boost leaderboard rankings for better workload allocation.</li>
<li>Participate in governance decisions via the YOM DAO.</li>
<li>Gain eligibility for additional $YOM drops and rewards.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Is $YOM inflationary or deflationary?</strong></h4>
<p>YOM follows a <strong>deflationary model</strong>, meaning no new
tokens are minted, and a portion of each transaction is burned, reducing
supply over time. This ensures value retention for stakeholders.</p>
<h4><strong>How can I earn more rewards?</strong></h4>
<p>Increase earnings by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining high uptime and reliability for better workload
allocation.</li>
<li>Participating in the <strong>Streak Program</strong>, which provides
bonus rewards for consistent online presence.</li>
<li>Accumulating XP to boost node rankings and priority.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>5. Governance &amp; Community</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>How does governance work in the YOM ecosystem?</strong></h4>
<p>YOM operates under a <strong>DAO model</strong>, allowing the
community to influence key decisions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform policies and content guidelines.</li>
<li>Allocation of treasury funds to support network growth.</li>
<li>Voting on feature updates and ecosystem improvements.</li>
